Hello!

This email contains information for the UPPMAX/HPC2N/LUNARC three days online course “Introduction to running R, Matlab, and Julia in HPC”, which will be given `[course_dates]`, 9:00-16:00 each day. The course is given under NAISS.

NOTE that the course starts at 9:00 not 9:15! 9:00 – 9:45 each day is an optional login session. Please attend this if you need help with logging in, downloading the exercises, etc. Also see the schedule linked below, for each day.

We will use Zoom for this online course. See below for links (#11).

NOTE please go through everything, as there is important information about pre-requirements, how to login, etc. Also be aware that you may need to set up MFA for UPPMAX and NSC, Pocket Pass for LUNARC, and SSH keys/kerberos for PDC (depending on which system you are using), which can take a day to get setup, so do this immediately.

NOTE that there is also an onboarding session on `[onboarding_date_and_time]` (see #9 below) if you need help with accounts, MFA, etc.

1) Schedule:

R (Monday): https://uppmax.github.io/R-matlab-julia-HPC/r/scheduleR.html

MATLAB (Tuesday): https://uppmax.github.io/R-matlab-julia-HPC/matlab/scheduleMatlab.html

Julia (Wednesday): https://uppmax.github.io/R-matlab-julia-HPC/julia/scheduleJulia.html

2) Materials: https://github.com/UPPMAX/R-matlab-julia-HPC



3) Rendered presentations for the course: https://uppmax.github.io/R-matlab-julia-HPC/index.html



4) Important information about the course is gathered here: `[url_to_document]`

5) Questions and answers page for the course: `[url_to_q_and_a_document]`


6) Please make sure you have an account at SUPR (https://supr.naiss.se/) and at either NSC or PDC (or UPPMAX, if you are affiliated with UU or HPC2N if you are affiliated with UMU, SLU, IRF, LTU, or MIUN, or LUNARC if you are affiliated with LU). The site account for NSC/PDC/UPPMAX/HPC2N/LUNARC can be applied for through SUPR after you have your SUPR account and have been added to the course project. The account at SUPR and the accounts at NSC/PDC/HPC2N/UPPMAX/LUNARC are all SEPARATE. You should have already been contacted about getting such accounts if you did not already have them.



7) Please make sure you have installed either ThinLinc or an SSH client. ThinLinc is strongly RECOMMENDED for this course and can be installed from https://www.cendio.com/thinlinc/download

Note that if you are using ThinLinc, you will connect to a graphical interface and do not need a separate X11 server to enable opening graphics and GUIs.

Note that if you are using Windows and do not already have an SSH client you use, we strongly recommend using ThinLinc.



8) Pre-requirements: This page contains some info on getting ready to login (including the above info), but also a short summary/list of links for things like Linux, editors, and coding: https://uppmax.github.io/R-matlab-julia-HPC/prereqs.html



9) Onboarding: If you need help with logging in, ThinLinc, etc. then we have an optional onboarding session `[onboarding_data_and_time]`. Zoom for onboarding (same zoom as for the course itself): `[url_course_zoom_room]`



10) Course project and policy: As part of the hands-on, you will be given temporary access to a course project, which will be used for running the hands-on examples. There are some policies regarding this, that we ask that you follow:

You may be given access to the project before the course; please do not use the allocation for running your own codes. Usage of the project before the course means the priority of jobs submitted to it goes down, diminishing the opportunity for you and your fellow participants to run the examples during the course.
The course project will be open 1-2 weeks after the course, giving the participants the opportunity to test run examples and shorter codes related to the course. During this time, we ask that you only use it for running course related jobs. Use your own discretion, but it could be: (modified) examples from the hands-on, short personal codes that have been modified to test things learned at the course, etc.
Anyone found to be misusing the course project, using up large amounts of the allocation for their own production runs, will be removed from the course project.
When the course is no longer active, all files in the attached storage directory will be deleted. Please copy out anything you want to save before that.

11) Zoom info for the course:

a) There will be a zoom for the lectures. It is the same zoom link for each day.

b) When you join the Zoom meeting, use your REAL NAME.

c) Please MUTE your microphone when you are not speaking and use the “Raise hand” functionality under the “Participants” window during the lecture. Please do not clutter the Zoom chat. Behave politely!

d) If you have questions during the lectures, you can write them on this page: `[url_to_q_and_a_document]`

e) There may be breakout rooms used in the Zoom for the hands-ons and for discussions. Most likely there will be a “silent” room for those who just wish to work on their own, a discussion room (or rooms) for cooperation, and the rest will be in the main room. If you are in the silent room and need help, go to the main room and contact a helper. There will be breakout rooms that can be used if you want individual help. There will also be parallel sessions.

f) The lectures and demos will be recorded, but not the hands-ons sessions. If you ask questions during the lectures, you may thus be recorded. If you do not wish to be recorded, then please keep your microphone muted and your camera off and write your questions in the Q/A document.



ZOOM (same each day):

Meeting ID: `[zoom_room_meeting_id]`
Passcode: `[zoom_room_passcode]`
