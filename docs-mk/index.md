# Welcome to R-MATLAB-Julia course material

!!! info "This material"

   Here you will find the content of the workshop Using Python in an HPC environment.

   - Documentation at the HPC centres UPPMAX and HPC2N
      - UPPMAX: https://www.uppmax.uu.se/support/user-guides/python-user-guide/
      - HPC2N: https://www.hpc2n.umu.se/resources/software/user_installed/python

!!! info "Content"

   - This course aims to give a brief, but comprehensive introduction to using Python in an HPC environment.
   - You will learn how to
      - use modules to load Python
      - find site installed Python packages
      - install packages yourself
      - use virtual environments,
      - write a batch script for running Python
      - use Python in parallel
      - how to use Python for ML and on GPUs.
   - This course will consist of lectures interspersed with hands-on sessions where you get to try out what you have just learned.

!!! info "Cluster-specific approaches"

   - The course is a cooperation between UPPMAX (Rackham, Snowy, Bianca) and HPC2N (Kebnekaise) and will focus on the compute systems at both centres.
   - For the site-specific part of the course you will be divided into groups depending on which center you will be running your code, as the approach is somewhat different.
