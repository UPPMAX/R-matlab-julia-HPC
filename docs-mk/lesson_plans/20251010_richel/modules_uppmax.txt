  ADMIXTURE: ADMIXTURE/1.3.0
    ADMIXTURE is a software tool for maximum likelihood estimation of individual
    ancestries from multilocus SNP genotype datasets. It uses the same statistical
    model as STRUCTURE but calculates estimates much more rapidly using a fast
    numerical optimization algorithm. PDF manual available at
    $EBROOTADMIXTURE/doc/admixture-manual.pdf Specifically, ADMIXTURE uses a block
    relaxation approach to alternately update allele frequency and ancestry fraction
    parameters. Each block update is handled by solving a large number of independent
    convex optimization problems, which are tackled using a fast sequential quadratic
    programming algorithm. Convergence of the algorithm is accelerated using a novel
    quasi-Newton acceleration method. The algorithm outperforms EM algorithms and MCMC
    sampling methods by a wide margin. For details, see our publications: D.H.
    Alexander, J. Novembre, and K. Lange. Fast model-based estimation of ancestry in
    unrelated individuals. Genome Research, 19:1655-1664, 2009. H. Zhou, D. H.

    are well documented, and it is particularly easy to invent your own language (or
    port an existing compiler) to use LLVM as an optimizer and code generator.

    multiple software packages and enables developers to write a single implementation
    that works across many different codes. The API is sufficiently general to support
    a wide variety of techniques, including QM/MM, ab initio MD, machine learning,
    advanced sampling, and path integral MD, while also being straightforwardly
    extensible. Communication between codes is handled by the MDI Library, which
    enables tight coupling between codes using either the MPI or TCP/IP methods.

    transports like in-process, inter-process, TCP, and multicast. You can connect
    sockets N-to-N with patterns like fanout, pub-sub, task distribution, and
    request-reply. It's fast enough to be the fabric for clustered products. Its
    asynchronous I/O model gives you scalable multicore applications, built as
    asynchronous message-processing tasks. It has a score of language APIs and runs on
    most operating systems.

    between long noisy reads, or map long reads or their assemblies to a reference
    genome optionally with detailed alignment (i.e. CIGAR). At present, it works
    efficiently with query sequences from a few kilobases to ~100 megabases in length
    at an error rate ~15%. Minimap2 outputs in the PAF or the SAM format. On limited
    test data sets, minimap2 is over 20 times faster than most other long-read
    aligners. It will replace BWA-MEM for long reads and contig alignment.

    The Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) recommends banning certain C Library
    functions because they directly contribute to security vulnerabilities such as
    buffer overflows. However routines for the manipulation of strings and memory
    buffers are common in software and firmware, and are essential to accomplish
    certain programming tasks. Safer replacements for these functions that avoid or
    prevent serious security vulnerabilities (e.g. buffer overflows, string format
    attacks, conversion overflows/underflows, etc.) are available in the SafeString
    Library.
