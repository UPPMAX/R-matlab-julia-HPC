Load and run
############

.. challenge:: Try yourself to load R, start it, check libraries, load a library, quit R
    
    .. code-block:: R
    
        1) Load R version 4.0.4 
        2) Start R. Check which libraries are installed. Load one of them.
        3) Quit R
	
    Remember to check if a module you are loading has prerequisites, and load those first if it does. In this case it depends on whether you do the exercises on Kebnekaise or Rackham.

	    As you can see above, the main differences here compared to Rackham is that you need to load some prerequisites before you can load R and that doing ``ml spider R/<version>`` will give you a long list of "extensions" which is what the module system calls the system installed R packages. 
 	    

.. challenge:: Load R and run a short R script from the command line
    
    .. code-block:: sh
    
        1) Load R version 4.0.4 (if you have not done so already)
 	    2) Run the small R script called ``hello.R``, using ``Rscript``
	
    Remember to check if a module you are loading has prerequisites, and load those first if it does. In this case it depends on whether you do the exercises on Kebnekaise or Rackham. 

.. admonition:: "hello.R" (it can also be found under "R" in the "Exercises" directory on the course GitHub repository (https://github.com/UPPMAX/R-python-julia-HPC). 

   .. code-block:: R
   
      message <-"Hello World!"
      print(message) 


.. solution:: Solution

   .. tabs:: 

      .. tab:: UPPMAX
 
            This is for Rackham.
          
            .. code-block:: sh
	    
	       [bbrydsoe@rackham2 bbrydsoe]$ Rscript hello.R
	       [1] "Hello World!"
	       [bbrydsoe@rackham2 bbrydsoe]$

      .. tab:: HPC2N
 
            This is for Kebnekaise. 
          
            .. code-block:: sh
	    
	       b-an01 [~]$ Rscript hello.R
	       [1] "Hello World!"
	       b-an01 [~]$ 

	    
      As you can see, it is working the same. 
      


Packages
########

.. challenge:: Install a package with automatic download

   1) First do the setup of .Renviron and create the directory for installing R
   packages. Remember to load any modules you need. 
   2) Install a package from the command line. Suggestion: the package "anomalize"
   3) Install a package from inside R. Suggestion: the package "tidyr"
   4) Start R and see if the library can be loaded. 
   
   These are both on CRAN, and this way any dependencies will be installed as
   well. 
   
   Remember to pick a repo that is nearby, to install from:
   https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html 


.. solution:: Solution

   .. tabs:: 

      .. tab:: Setup
      
            .. code-block:: sh
	 
               [bbrydsoe@rackham3 bbrydsoe]$ echo R_LIBS_USER=\"$HOME/R-packages-%V\" > ~/.Renviron R_LIBS_USER="/home/bbrydsoe/R-packages-%V"
               [bbrydsoe@rackham3 bbrydsoe]$ mkdir -p $HOME/R-packages-4.0.4
	    

      .. tab:: Command line
      
            Installing package "anomalize". Using the repo http://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/CRAN/
         
            .. code-block:: sh
	 
	           [bbrydsoe@rackham3 bbrydsoe]$ R --quiet --no-save --no-restore -e "install.packages('anomalize', repo='http://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/CRAN/')"
           
           
           This assumes you have already loaded the R module. If not, then do so first. 
	 
      .. tab:: Inside R
      
            Installing package "tidyr". Using the repo http://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/CRAN/

            .. code-block:: R 

               > install.packages('tidyr', repo='http://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/CRAN/')	     
	     
      .. tab:: Load library

            .. code-block:: R
	 
  	           [bbrydsoe@rackham3 bbrydsoe]$ R
               > library("anomalize")
               > library("tidyr")
	    
 	        "anomalize" outputs some text/advertisment when loaded. You can ignore this.
