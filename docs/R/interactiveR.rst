Interactive work on the compute nodes
=========================================================

.. note::

   - It is possible to run R directly on the login (including ThinLinc) nodes.
   - But this should *only* be done for shorter jobs or jobs that do not use a
     lot of resources, as the login nodes can otherwise become slow for all
     users. Both Python and IPython exists as modules to load and run.
   - If you want to work interactively with your code or data, you should start
     an interactive session.
   - If you rather will run a script which won't use any interactive user input
     while running, you should instead start a batch job, see previous session.
   
.. questions::

   - How to reach the calculation nodes
   - How do I proceed to work interactively?
   
.. objectives:: 

   - Show how to reach the calculation nodes on UPPMAX and HPC2N
   - Test some commands on the calculation nodes

There are several ways to run R interactively

- Directly on the login nodes: **only** do this for short jobs that do not take
  a lot of resources. E.g. a simple visualization.
- As an interactive job on the computer nodes, launched via the batch system
- Using Rstudio (more on this later)


General
-------

In order to run interactively, you need to have compute nodes allocated to run
on, and this is done through the batch system.  

Because you will have to wait until the nodes are allocated, and because you
cannot know when this happens, this is not usually a recommended way to run
Python, but it is possible. 

.. warning::

    (HPC2N) Do note that it is not *real* interactivity as you probably mean
    it, as you will have to run it as a Python script instead of by starting
    Python and giving commands inside it. The reason for this is that you are
    not actually logged into the compute node and only sees the output of the
    commands you run. 


R "interactively" on the compute nodes 
-------------------------------------------

To run interactively, you need to allocate resources on the cluster first. You
can use the command salloc to allow interactive use of resources allocated to
your job. When the resources are allocated, you need to preface commands with
``srun`` in order to run on the allocated nodes instead of the login node. 
      
- First, you make a request for resources with ``interactive``/``salloc``, like this:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: UPPMAX (interactive)

      .. code-block:: sh
          
         $ interactive -n <tasks> --time=HHH:MM:SS -A naiss2023-22-44 
      
   .. tab:: HPC2N (salloc)

      .. code-block:: sh
          
         $ salloc -n <tasks> --time=HHH:MM:SS -A hpc2nXXXX-YYY 
         
      
where <tasks> is the number of tasks (or cores, for default 1 task per core), time is given in 
      hours, minutes, and seconds (maximum T168 hours), and then you give the id for your project 
      (**naiss2023-22-44** for this course)

Your request enters the job queue just like any other job, and interactive/salloc will tell you that it is
      waiting for the requested resources. When salloc tells you that your job has been allocated 
      resources, you can interactively run programs on those resources with ``srun``. The commands 
      you run with ``srun`` will then be executed on the resources your job has been allocated. 
      If you do not preface with ``srun`` the command is run on the login node! 
      

You can now run R scripts on the allocated resources directly instead of waiting for 
      your batch job to return a result. This is an advantage if you want to test your R 
      script or perhaps figure out which parameters are best.
                  

Example **Code along**
######################

**Requesting 4 cores for 10 minutes, then running R**

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: UPPMAX

      .. code-block:: sh
      
          [bjornc@rackham2 ~]$ interactive -A naiss2023-22-44 -p devcore -n 4 -t 10:00
          You receive the high interactive priority.
          There are free cores, so your job is expected to start at once.
      
          Please, use no more than 6.4 GB of RAM.
      
          Waiting for job 29556505 to start...
          Starting job now -- you waited for 1 second.
          
          [bjornc@r484 ~]$ module load R/1.8.5

      Let us check that we actually run on the compute node: 

      .. code-block:: sh
      
          [bjornc@r483 ~]$ srun hostname
          r483.uppmax.uu.se
          r483.uppmax.uu.se
          r483.uppmax.uu.se
          r483.uppmax.uu.se

      We are. Notice that we got a response from all four cores we have allocated.   

   .. tab:: HPC2N
         
      .. code-block:: sh
      
          b-an01 [~]$ salloc -n 4 --time=00:30:00 -A hpc2nXXXX-YYY
          salloc: Pending job allocation 20174806
          salloc: job 20174806 queued and waiting for resources
          salloc: job 20174806 has been allocated resources
          salloc: Granted job allocation 20174806
          salloc: Waiting for resource configuration
          salloc: Nodes b-cn0241 are ready for job
          b-an01 [~]$ module load GCC/10.3.0 OpenMPI/4.1.1 R/1.8.5
          b-an01 [~]$ 
                  
      
      Let us check that we actually run on the compute node: 
      
      .. code-block:: sh
                  
           b-an01 [~]$ srun hostname
           b-cn0241.hpc2n.umu.se
           b-cn0241.hpc2n.umu.se
           b-cn0241.hpc2n.umu.se
           b-cn0241.hpc2n.umu.se
      
      We are. Notice that we got a response from all four cores we have allocated.   
      
      
Running a script
''''''''''''''''

**The script** 
      Adding two numbers from user input (serial_sum.R)
         
      .. code-block:: R
      
          # This program will add two numbers that are provided by the user
          args = commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE)
          res = as.numeric(args[1]) + as.numeric(args[2])
          print(paste("The sum of the two numbers is", res))
      
**Running the script**

- Note that the commands are the same for both HPC2N and UPPMAX!
      
      Running a R script in the allocation we made further up. Notice that since we asked for 4 cores, the script is run 4 times, since it is a serial script
         
      .. code-block:: sh

          ❯ srun Rscript serial_sum.R 3 4
          [1] "The sum of the two numbers is 7"
          [1] "The sum of the two numbers is 7"
          [1] "The sum of the two numbers is 7"
          [1] "The sum of the two numbers is 7"
 
      Without the ``srun`` command, R won't understand that it can use several
      cores. Therefor the program is run only once.
                  
      .. code-block:: sh 
                  
          ❯ Rscript serial_sum.R 3 4
          [1] "The sum of the two numbers is 7"

**Running R interpreter (UPPMAX)**

- First start R and check available workers with ``future``

      .. code-block:: sh 

         > library(future)
         > availableWorkers()
         [1] "r483" "r483" "r483" "r483"
         > availableCores()
         nproc
             4


**Exit**

When you have finished using the allocation, either wait for it to end, or close it with ``exit``

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: UPPMAX
   
      .. code-block:: sh 
                  
                  [bjornc@r484 ~]$ exit
      
                  exit
                  [screen is terminating]
                  Connection to r484 closed.
      
                  [bjornc@rackham2 ~]$
     
   .. tab:: HPC2N
   
      .. code-block:: sh 
                  
                  b-an01 [~]$ exit
                  exit
                  salloc: Relinquishing job allocation 20174806
                  salloc: Job allocation 20174806 has been revoked.
                  b-an01 [~]$

.. keypoints::

   - Start an interactive session on a calculation node by a SLURM allocation
   
      - At HPC2N: ``salloc`` ...
      - At UPPMAX: ``interactive`` ...
   - Follow the same procedure as usual by loading the R module and possible prerequisites.
