What is R?
---------------

As you probably already knowâ€¦
    
    - R is a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. 
    - R's data structures include vectors, arrays, lists, and data frames.
    - R is an interpreted language; users can access it through a command-line interpreter.
    - It supports procedural programming with functions and, for some functions, object-oriented programming with generic functions. 
    - It has many user-created packages to augment the functions of the R language. These packages offer statistical techniques, graphical devices, import/export, reporting (RMarkdown, knitr, Sweave), etc.
    - It is one of the most commonly used programming languages in data mining.

In short; R has statistics-related libraries of a great variety and provides a good environment for statistical computing and design. Also, the R programming language is very useful for data importing and cleaning.

- Official R documentation is found here: https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html
- A list of CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network) is here: https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html
- Data analysis workflows with R and Python: https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/data-analysis-workflows-course/
- CodeRefinery develops and maintains training material on software best practices for researchers that already write code. Ther material addresses all academic disciplines and tries to be as programming language-independent as possible. https://coderefinery.org/lessons/
    

.. objectives:: 

    We will:
    
    - teach you how to navigate the module system at HPC2N and UPPMAX
    - show you how to find out which versions of R and packages are installed
    - look at how to install other R packages yourself
    - show you how to run batch jobs 
    - show some examples on using R
