Load and run R
===================

At both UPPMAX and HPC2N we call the applications available via the module system modules. 
    - https://www.uppmax.uu.se/resources/software/module-system/ 
    - https://www.hpc2n.umu.se/documentation/environment/lmod 

   
.. objectives:: 

   - Show how to load R
   - Show how to run R scripts and start R on the command line

    - See which modules exists: ``module spider`` or ``ml spider``
    - Find module versions for a particular software: ``module spider <software>``
    - Modules depending only on what is currently loaded: ``module avail`` or ``ml av``
    - See which modules are currently loaded: ``module list`` or ``ml``
    - Load a module: ``module load <module>/<version>`` or ``ml <module>/<version>``
    - Unload a module: ``module unload <module>/<version>`` or ``ml -<module>/<version>``
    - More information about a module: ``module show <module>/<version>`` or ``ml show <module>/<version>``
    - Unload all modules except the 'sticky' modules: ``module purge`` or ``ml purge``
    
.. warning::
   Note that the module systems at UPPMAX and HPC2 are slightly different. While all modules at UPPMAX not directly related to bio-informatics are shown by ``ml avail``, most modules at HPC2N are hidden until one has loaded a prerequisite like the compiler ``GCC``.


- For reproducibility reasons, you should always load a specific version of a module instead of just the default version
- Many modules have prerequisite modules which needs to be loaded first (at HPC2N this is also the case for the R modules). When doing ``module spider <module>/<version>`` you will get a list of which other modules needs to be loaded first


Check for R versions
-------------------------


.. tabs::

   .. tab:: UPPMAX

     Check all available R versions with:

      .. code-block:: console
 
           $ module spider R

     OR

      .. code-block:: console

           $ module avail R
 
     Note that the latter option also lists other software modules matching the string "R". 


   .. tab:: HPC2N
   
      Check all available version R versions with:

      .. code-block:: console
 
         $ module spider R
      
      To see how to load a specific version of R, including the prerequisites, do 

      .. code-block:: console
   
         $ module spider R/<version>

      Example for R 4.0.4 (recommended version)

      .. code-block:: console

         $ module spider R/4.0.4

Load an R module
--------------------

For reproducibility, we recommend ALWAYS loading a specific module instead of using the default version! 

For this course, we recommend using R 4.0.4

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: UPPMAX
   
      Go back and check which R modules were available. To load version 4.0.4, do:

      .. code-block:: console

        $ module load R/4.0.4
        
      For short, you can also use: 

      .. code-block:: console

         $ ml R/4.0.4

 
   .. tab:: HPC2N

 
      .. code-block:: console

         $ module load GCC/10.2.0  OpenMPI/4.0.5  R/4.0.4
      
         (or 'module load GCC/10.2.0  CUDA/11.1.1  OpenMPI/4.0.5  R/4.0.4' if you need CUDA)

      For short, you can also use: 

      .. code-block:: console

         $ ml GCC/10.2.0  OpenMPI/4.0.5  R/4.0.4

.. warning::

   + UPPMAX: Donâ€™t use system-installed R/3.6.0
   + HPC2N: No system installed R 
   + ALWAYS use R module


Run
---

Run R from command line 
#######################

After loading the R module (and its prerequisites), you start R like this (Kebnekaise, R/4.0.4): 

  .. code-block:: sh

     b-an01 [~]$ R

     'help.start()' for an HTML browser interface to help.
     Type 'q()' to quit R.
     
     > 
     
     
Run R script
#####################
    
You can run an R script in the shell like this:

.. code-block:: console

   $ Rscript example.R

NOTE: *only* run jobs that are short and/or do not use a lot of resources from the command line. Otherwise ALWAYS use the batch system!
    
More information will follow on running R from within a **batch job**. 

Exit R with q() in the R prompt. Decide if you want to save your workspace image or not. 

Here is an example of running a short, serial R program at Kebnekaise: 

  .. admonition:: Serial R program (add2.R) to add two arguments
      :class: dropdown

          .. code-block:: tcl
        
         
             args <- commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE)
             num1 <- as.numeric(args[1])
             num2 <- as.numeric(args[2])
            
             answer <- num1 + num2
             cat("Sum of arguments is: ", answer)
             cat("\n")
           
           
  .. code-block:: sh

    b-an01 [~]$ Rscript add2.R 3 4
    Sum of arguments is:  7
    b-an01 [~]$

.. admonition:: Workflow

   In addition to loading R, you will also often need to (install and) use own-installed R packages. The work-flow would be something like this: 
    
   1) Load R and prerequisites: ``module load <pre-reqs> R/<version>``
   2) Check which extensions your R version has. They are generally listed under "Extensions" when you do: 
   
      - ``module spider R/<version>``. 
      - Otherwise, you can do ``installed.packages()`` from within R. 
      - NOTE that the latter option generates a LOT of output, but also gives versions of the R packages (Extensions, as they are called by the module system). 
      
   3) Install any extra R packages you need (optional): 
    
      - Automatical download and install: ``R --quiet --no-save --no-restore -e "install.packages('<r-package>', repos='http://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/CRAN/')"`` 
      - Manual download and install: ``R CMD INSTALL -l <path-to-R-package>/R-package.tar.gz``
    
   4) 
    
      - Start R: ``R``
      - run ``Rscript <program.R>``
      - batch job for R program: ``sbatch <my-R-batch-job.sh>``

   - Installed R packages can be accessed within R with ``library("package")`` as usual. 

   - The command ``installed.packages()`` given within R will list the available packages to import. 

   - More about installing your own R packages to follow in later sections of the course! 


.. keypoints::

   - Before you can run R scripts or work in an R shell, first load an R module and any needed prerequisites. 
   - Start an R shell session with ``R``.
   - Run scripts with ``Rscript <script.R>``
    

Exercises
---------

.. challenge:: Try yourself to load R, start it, check libraries, load a library, quit R
    
    .. code-block:: R
    
        1) Load R version 4.0.4 
	2) Start R. Check which libraries are installed. Load one of them.
	3) Quit R
	
    Remember to check if a module you are loading has prerequisites, and load those first if it does. In this case it depends on whether you do the exercises on Kebnekaise or Rackham.

	    As you can see above, the main differences here compared to Rackham is that you need to load some prerequisites before you can load R and that doing ``ml spider R/<version>`` will give you a long list of "extensions" which is what the module system calls the system installed R packages. 
 	    

.. challenge:: Load R and run a short R script from the command line
    
    .. code-block:: sh
    
        1) Load R version 4.0.4 (if you have not done so already)
	2) Run the small R script called ``hello.R``, using ``Rscript``
	
    Remember to check if a module you are loading has prerequisites, and load those first if it does. In this case it depends on whether you do the exercises on Kebnekaise or Rackham. 

.. admonition:: "hello.R" (it can also be found under "R" in the "Exercises" directory on the course GitHub repository (https://github.com/UPPMAX/R-python-julia-HPC).
