Packages

.. admonition:: R packages

   - R packages is the main way of extending the functionallity of R and
     **broadens the use of R** to almost infinity! 

   - Instead of writing code yourself there may be others that have done the
     same!

   - Many **scientific tools** are distributed as **R packages**, making it
     possible to run a script in the prompt and there define files to be
     analysed and arguments defining exactly what to do.

   - For more details about packages and in particular developing your own,
     see: `R packages <https://r-pkgs.org>`_

R packages: A short Primer
--------------------------

What is a package, really?
##########################

An R package is essentialy a contained folder and file structure containing R
code (and possibly C/C++ or other code) and other files relevant for the
package e.g. documentation(vignettes), licensing and configuration files. Let
us look at a very simple example 


.. code-block:: sh

   $ git clone git@github.com:MatPiq/R_example.git

   $ cd R_example

   $ tree
   .
   ├── DESCRIPTION
   ├── NAMESPACE
   ├── R
   │   └── hello.R
   ├── man
   │   └── hello.Rd
   └── r_example.Rproj

Package states
##############

An R packages can exist in five possible states

- Source: The example above - "source code" or "source files". Development
  form.
- Bundled: The source code compressed into a single file, usually `tar.gz` and
  sometimes refered to as "source tarballs". Files in `.Rbuildignore` are
  excluded.
- Binary: A compressed and pre-compiled version of a bundle built for a
  specific architecture. Usually how the package is provided by CRAN. Much
  faster than having to compile yourself and no need for dev/build tools.
- Installed: A decompressed binary package located in a package _library_ (more
  on this later).
- In-memory: When the installed package has been loaded from the library into
  memory, using `require(pkg)` or `library(pkg)`.

Package libraries
#################

    In R, a library is a directory containing installed packages, sort of like
    a library for books. Unfortunately, in the R world, you will frequently
    encounter confused usage of the words “library” and “package”. It’s common
    for someone to refer to dplyr, for example, as a library when it is
    actually a package (Wickham & Hadley, 2023).

We might want to know where the ``R`` interpreter will be searching for
packages, i.e. where the libraries are located (could be several). The easiest
way to check is probably starting the interpreter and running the ``libPaths()`` function.


.. tabs::

   .. tab:: UPPMAX

      Load ``R``, e.g. version 4.1.1 and start the Interpreter

      .. code-block:: sh 

         $ ml R/4.1.1
         $ R

      Then check find the path of the library using the ``libPaths()`` function.

      .. code-block:: R
      
         > .libPaths()
         [1] "/sw/apps/R/4.1.1/rackham/lib64/R/library"
	
   .. tab:: HPC2N
   
      Load ``R``, e.g. version 4.1.1 and start the Interpreter

      .. code-block:: sh 

         $ ml GCC/10.2.0  OpenMPI/4.0.5  R/4.0.4
         $ R

      Then check find the path of the library using the ``libPaths()`` function.

      .. code-block:: R
      
         > .libPaths()
         [1] "/cvmfs/ebsw.hpc2n.umu.se/amd64_ubuntu2004_bdw/software/R/4.0.4-foss-2020b/lib/R/library"





Installing your own packages
----------------------------

Sometimes you will need R packages that are not already installed. The solution to this is to install your own packages. These packages will usually come from CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/) - the Comprehensive R Archive Network, or sometimes from other places, like GitHub or R-Forge

Here we will look at installing R packages with automatic download and with manual download. It is also possible to install from inside Rstudio. 

Setup
#####

We need to create a place for the own-installed packages to be and to tell R where to find them. The initial setup only needs to be done once, but separate package directories need to be created for each R version used. 

R reads the ``$HOME/.Renviron`` file to setup its environment. It should be created by R on first run, or you can create it with the command: ``touch $HOME/.Renviron``

**NOTE**: In this example we are going to assume you have chosen to place the R packages in a directory under your home directory. As mentioned, you will need separate ones for each R version.

If you have not yet installed any packages to R yourself, the environment file should be empty and you can update it like this: 

.. code-block:: sh 

    echo R_LIBS_USER=\"$HOME/R-packages-%V\" > ~/.Renviron

If it is **not** empty, you can edit ``$HOME/.Renviron`` with your favorite editor so that ``R_LIBS_USER`` contain the path to your chosen directory for own-installed R packages. It should look something like this when you are done:

.. code-block:: sh 

    R_LIBS_USER="/home/u/user/R-packages-%V"


| NOTE: Replace ``/home/u/user`` with the value of ``$HOME``. Run ``echo $HOME`` to see its value.
| NOTE: The ``%V`` should be written as-is, it's substituted at runtime with the active R version.

For each version of R you are using, create a directory matching the pattern used in ``.Renviron`` to store your packages in. This example is shown for R version 4.0.4:

.. code-block:: sh 

    mkdir -p $HOME/R-packages-4.0.4


Automatical download and install from CRAN
##########################################

.. note:: 

    You find a list of packages in CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/) and a list of repos here: https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html 

    Please choose a location close to you when picking a repo. 


.. tabs::

   .. tab:: From command line

      .. code-block:: sh 

          R --quiet --no-save --no-restore -e "install.packages('<r-package>', repos='<repo>')"
    
   .. tab:: From inside R

      .. code-block:: sh 

          install.packages('<r-package>', repos='<repo>')
       

In either case, the dependencies of the package will be downloaded and installed as well. 

      
Example
*******

In this example, we will install the R package ``stringr`` and use the repository http://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/CRAN/ 

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: From command line

      .. code-block:: sh 

          R --quiet --no-save --no-restore -e "install.packages('stringr', repos='http://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/CRAN/')"
       
   .. tab:: From inside R

      .. code-block:: sh 

          install.packages('stringr', repos='http://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/CRAN/')



Automatic download and install from GitHub
##########################################

If you want to install a package that is not on CRAN, but which do have a GitHub page, then there is an automatic way of installing, but you need to handle prerequsites yourself by installing those first. It can also be that the package is not in as finished a state as those on CRAN, so be careful. 

To install packages from GitHub directly, from inside R, you first need to install the devtools package. Note that you only need to install this **once**. 

This is how you install a package from GitHub, inside R:

 .. code-block:: R
 
    install.packages("devtools")   # ONLY ONCE
    devtools::install_github("DeveloperName/package")
    

Example
*******

In this example we want to install the package ``quantstrat``. It is not on CRAN, so let's get it from the GitHub page for the project: https://github.com/braverock/quantstrat 

We also need to install devtools so we can install packages from GitHub. In addition, ``quantstrat`` has some prerequisites, some on CRAN, some on GitHub, so we need to install those as well. 

.. code-block:: sh 

   install.packages("devtools") # ONLY ONCE
   install.packages("FinancialInstrument") 
   install.packages("PerformanceAnalytics") 
   
   devtools::install_github("braverock/blotter")
   devtools::install_github("braverock/quantstrat")

    
Manual download and install
###########################

If the package is not on CRAN or you want the development version, or you for other reason want to install a package you downloaded, then this is how to install from the command line: 

.. code-block:: sh 

    R CMD INSTALL -l <path-to-R-package>/R-package.tar.gz
    

**NOTE** that if you install a package this way, you need to handle any dependencies yourself. 

.. note:: 

   Places to look for R packages
   
   - CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/)
   - R-Forge (https://r-forge.r-project.org/)
   - Project's own GitHub page
   - etc.
   

.. keypoints::

   - You can check for installed packages 
   	- from inside R with ``installed.packages()``
	- from BASH shell with the 
		- ``ml help R/<version>`` at UPPMAX
		- ``ml spider R/<version>`` at HPC2N
   - Installation of R packages can be done either from within R or from the command line (BASH shell)
   - CRAN is the recommended place to look for R-packages, but many packages can be found on GitHub and if you want the development version of a package you likely need to get it from GitHub or other place outside CRAN. You would then either download and install manually or install with something like devtools, from within R. 

Exercises
---------

.. challenge:: Install a package with automatic download

   1) First do the setup of .Renviron and create the directory for installing R packages
   2) From the command line. Suggestion: "anomalize"
   3) From inside R. Suggestion: "tidyr"
   4) Start R and see if the library can be loaded. 
   
   These are both on CRAN, and this way any dependencies will be installed as well. 
   
   Remember to pick a repo that is nearby, to install from: https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html

      .. tab:: Setup
      
         .. code-block:: sh
	 
            [bbrydsoe@rackham3 bbrydsoe]$ echo R_LIBS_USER=\"$HOME/R-packages-%V\" > ~/.Renviron
	    R_LIBS_USER="/home/bbrydsoe/R-packages-%V"
	    [bbrydsoe@rackham3 bbrydsoe]$ mkdir -p $HOME/R-packages-4.0.4

      .. tab:: From the command line. Installing package "anomalize". I am using the repo http://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/CRAN/
         
         .. code-block:: sh
	 
	    [bbrydsoe@rackham3 bbrydsoe]$ R --quiet --no-save --no-restore -e "install.packages('anomalize', repo='http://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/CRAN/')"
	  
         This assumes you have already loaded the R module. If not, then do so first. 
	 
      .. tab:: From inside R. Installing package "tidyr"

         .. code-block:: R 

            install.packages('tidyr', repos='http://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/CRAN/')	     
	     
      .. tab:: Check if the package can be loaded

         .. code-block:: R
	 
	    [bbrydsoe@rackham3 bbrydsoe]$ R
	    > library("anomalize")
	    > library("tidyr")
	    
	 "anomalize" outputs some text/advertisment when loaded. You can ignore this.
