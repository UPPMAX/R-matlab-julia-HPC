# Evaluation

This is the page for evaluating the current iteration of the course.

The evaluation form for the Julia part can be found [here](https://forms.office.com/e/GveW41SeXR).
It takes into account that one may need to leave early too.

???- hint "Where can I find the results of earlier evaluations?"

    At [the 'Evaluations' page](../evaluations/README.md).

## Any feedback during the day

- `Form to submit any feedback during the day`

???- hint "For teachers: what is in that form?"

    Thanks for your feedback.
    This feedback will be published as-is at the end of the day,
    if and only if there are no personal details (email, address, etc.)
    in the feedback.
    Do mention the teachers, assistants, etc by name!

## Evaluation questions

- `Evaluation questions form`

???- hint "Why do you evaluate under lesson hours?"

    Because we value your time: your free time should be your free time.

    We think the time lost teaching is worth it to improve our teaching.

    Column text|Description
    -----------|---------------------------------
    `NA`       |I did not attend that session
    `0`        |I have no confidence I can do this
    `1`        |I have low confidence I can do this
    `2`        |I have some confidence I can do this
    `3`        |I have good confidence I can do this
    `4`        |I can absolutely do this!


    - Question 4: Would you recommend this course to someone else?

    ```text
    Multiple choice: Yes, no, not sure
    ```

    <!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 --><!-- Tables cannot be split up over lines, hence will break 80 characters per line -->

    - Question 5: Which future training topics would you like to be provided by the training host(s)?

    <!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->
