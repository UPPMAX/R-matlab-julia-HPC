## Parallel computing

## Thread parallelism

## Distributed parallelism

!!! info "Learning outcomes"

    - I can schedule jobs with distributed parallelism
    - I know the basic difference between threads and distributed memory in terms of memory share
    - I can explain how Julia/MATLAB/R code makes use of distributed parallelism

## Big data

!!! info "Learning outcomes"

    - I understand how I can work with big data
    - I know where to find more information about big data

## Introduction to GPUs

!!! note "Objectives"

    - Get an intro to common schemes for GPU code acceleration
    - Learn about the GPU nodes at HPC2N, UPPMAX, LUNARC, NSC, PDC, and C3SE
    - Learn how to make a batch script asking for GPU nodes at HPC2N, UPPMAX, LUNARC, NSC, PDC, and C3SE


## Machine Learning

!!! note "Questions"

    - What is it?
    - When/why to use it?
    - How to use it at HPC centres (R. MATLAB, Julia)
