    - [HPC2N](https://www.hpc2n.umu.se/resources/software/julia)
    - [LUNARC](The user demand on Julia has been low, so there is currently no site-specific documentation.)

## Courses

### Material for improving your programming skills

#### First level

[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) teaches basic lab skills for
research computing.

- [Programming with
  Julia](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/julia-novice/) (alpha)

### Second level

CodeRefinery develops and maintains training material on software best
practices for researchers that already write code. Their material
addresses all academic disciplines and tries to be as **programming
language-independent as possible**.

- Not yet anything Julia specific

[ENCCS (EuroCC National Competence Centre Sweden)](https://enccs.se/) is
a national centre that supports industry, public administration and
academia accessing and using European supercomputers. They give
higher-level training of programming and specific software.

- [Julia for high-performance
  Computing](https://enccs.github.io/julia-for-hpc/)
- [Julia for High-performance data
  analytics](https://enccs.github.io/julia-for-hpda/)

## IDEs

- Jupyter: Jupyter notebooks are familiar to many Python and R users.
- Pluto.jl: Offers a similar notebook experience to Jupyter, but
  understands global references between cells, and reactively
  re-evaluates cells affected by a code change.
- A text editor like nano, emacs, vim, etc., followed by running your
  code with julia filename.jl. There are also plugins for Julia for
  major text editors - do an internet search on e.g. “emacs julia” or
  “vim julia” to find out more.
