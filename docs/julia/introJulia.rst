What is Julia?
--------------

Julia is a relatively new Programming language (pre-released 1.0 announced in
2012) compared to well-known and standard languages such as Fortran, C, C++, R,
and Python (some of them dated back to the 70's). A common pattern in those
well-stablished languages (traditional paradigm) is that they look after either 
productivity (fast deployment, fast prototyping) or performance (fast numerical 
computations). 

This pattern created the so called **two-language problem** where programmers
had to choose between **productivity** (R, Python) or **performance** (Fortran, C/C++)
and when both were needed programmers had to learn the language that offered 
the desired capability and use some interface between different languages. 
Performant languages traditionally needed to be compiled while languages focusing
on productivity are interpreted.

Among the different features of Julia, is its capability of integrating
both aspects productivity and performance into a single language. In this way,
Julia programmers can in principle write software without changing their
focus to learn a new language.

Workflow in Julia
-----------------

After loading the appropriate modules for Julia, you will have access to the
read-eval-print-loop (REPL) command line by typing ``julia``:

   .. tab:: UPPMAX 

        .. code-block:: julia-repl

         julia> 

Julia has different modes, the one mentioned above is the so-called ``Julian`` mode
where one can execute commands. The description for accessing these modes will be
given in the following paragraphs. Once you are done with your work in any of the modes,
you can return to the ``Julian`` mode by pressing the ``backspace`` key.

While being on the Julian mode you can enter the ``shell`` mode by typing ``;``:

.. code-block:: julia

   julia>; 
   shell>pwd
   /current-folder-path

this will allow you to use Linux commands. Notice that the availabilty of these commands
depend on the OS, for instance, on Windows it will depend on the terminal that you have
installed and if it is visible to the Julia installation. 

Another mode available in Julia is the ``package manager`` mode, it can be accessed by typing ``]`` in the ``Julian`` mode:

.. code-block:: julia-repl

   julia>]
   (v1.8) pkg>

this will make your interaction with the package manager **Pkg** easier, for instance,
instead of typing the complete name of **Pkg** commands such as ``Pkg.status()`` in the
``Julian`` mode, you can just type ``status`` in the ``package`` mode. 

The last mode is the ``help`` mode, you can enter this mode from the ``Julian`` one by
typing ``?``, then you may type some string from which you need more information:

.. code-block:: julia-repl

   julia>?
   help?> ans
   search: ans transpose transcode contains expanduser instances MathConstants readlines LinearIndices leading_ones leading_zeros

   ans

   A variable referring to the last computed value, automatically set at the interactive prompt.

Features of Julia
-----------------

According to the Julia documentation (https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/) some of
the features of this language are:

- Good Base library with efficiently implemented operations written in Julia itself
- "Good performance, approaching that of statically-compiled languages like C"
- Modular and self-contained approach for libraries and development
- "A rich language of types for constructing and describing objects"
- A fast growing community of users and developers

Shortcomings of Julia
---------------------

- As this is a new language, the libraries ecosystem is not as rich as in Python or R, for instance
- Currently, using Julia for simple tasks (for instance, opening a file and writing text, plotting) is not as
  efficient as using Linux tools (AWK, GREP) or compiled languages (Fortran, C/C++, Rust)
- Previous situation is more noticeable upon running simple tasks in parallel mode (MPI, Threads)
  

Exercises
---------


.. challenge:: Getting familiar with Julia REPL
    
    Is is important in this course that you know how to navigate on the 
    Julia command line. This exercise will help you to become more familiar
    with the REPL. Do the following steps: 

       * Start a Julia session. In the ``Julian`` mode, compute the sum the numbers 
         5 and 6
       * Change to the ``shell`` mode and display the current directory
       * Now, go to the ``package`` mode and list the currently installed packages
       * Finally, display help information of the function ``println`` in ``help`` mode.

.. keypoints::

   - Julia is a relatively new language with several attractive features.
   - It offers several modes that can make your workflow easier, i.e., ``Julian``, 
     ``shell``, ``package manager``, and ``help`` modes.
