# A Julia notebook: Pluto

## Goals

- Learners 
    - understand the use cases (pros and cons)
    - can start a Pluto session
    - know in what environment to start

## General
Pluto, like Jupyter, is a programming notebook.

### Why is it a good tool?

- Reproducible (even without Pluto), gittable, extraordinarily interactive programming notebooks
- Offers a similar notebook experience to Jupyter, but understands global references between cells, and reactively re-evaluates cells affected by a code change.

### (Possible) use cases when Jupyter might be better.

## How to run

- Graphics
- Interactive session?
- packages and environments
- Start Pluto
