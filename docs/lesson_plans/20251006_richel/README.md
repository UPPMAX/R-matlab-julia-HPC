# Lesson plan R by Richel

- Date: Tuesday 2025-10-06
- Course: R

## 2025-09-17

I was happy with my progress on the advanced day
and started working on the MkDocs website.

## 2025-09-18

I continued working on the MkDocs website.
All CI tests are back.

All CI tests pass now.
As the session about parallelism has more unknown,
I will now focus on that one first.

## 2025-09-22

Parallelism is in good enough shape, with no unknowns left.
Let's remove the unknowns from this session too.

Progress is clear from the lesson material:

HPC Cluster|Documentation
-----------|------------
Alvis      |Only [OpenOnDemand doc](https://www.c3se.chalmers.se/documentation/connecting/ondemand/)
Berzelius  |[As good as no documentation](https://nsc.liu.se/software/catalogue/tetralith/modules/rstudio.html)
Bianca     |[Documentation](https://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/rstudio_on_bianca/)
COSMOS     |No documentation
Dardel     |No documentation
Kebnekaise |[Reasonable documentation](https://docs.hpc2n.umu.se/tutorials/connections/#interactive__apps__-__rstudio__server)
LUMI       |No documentation
Pelle      |[Documentation](https://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/rstudio_on_pelle/)
Rackham    |[Documentation](https://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/rstudio_on_rackham/)
Tetralith  |[As good as no documentation](https://nsc.liu.se/software/catalogue/tetralith/modules/rstudio.html), use [UPPMAX docs](https://docs.uppmax.uu.se/naiss/rstudio_on_tetralith/)
Vera       |Only [OpenOnDemand doc](https://www.c3se.chalmers.se/documentation/connecting/ondemand/)

There are, however, videos, that are not based on user documentation:

- [COSMOS RStudio](https://youtu.be/sPszk4DqI_U)
    - OpenOnDemand CPU setup: I will use this one
    - OpenOnDemand GPU setup
    - From terminal
- [HPC2N RStudio](https://youtu.be/V69FcmjzwwU)
    - From terminal, no interactive session
    - I will use: interactive session from terminal

Those videos will make it easy to write that user documentation.

## 2025-09-23

All is done, except:

- [x] RStudio video Pelle, reported at UPPMAX that ThinLinc cannot connect

## 2025-09-24

Done!
