Add-ons
=======

.. admonition:: Matlab add-ons and environments
   
   - Matlab **add-ons broaden the use of Matlab** considerably! 
   - Instead of writing code yourself there may be others that have done the same!
   - Isolated environments solve a couple of problems:

      - You can install specific, also older, versions into them.
      - You can create one for each project and no problem if the two projects require different versions.
      - You can remove the environment and create a new one, if not needed or with errors.
   
.. questions::

   - How to install add-ons?
   - How to work with isolated environments?
   - How to check for and use the UPPMAX pre-installed add-ons?
   

.. objectives:: 

   - Give a general *theoretical* introduction to isolated environments 
   - Show how to install own add-ons
   - Show how to check for Matlab add-ons at UPPMAX
   
- Before going into installing add-ons let's have a background to the Matlab environments and ecosystem!
