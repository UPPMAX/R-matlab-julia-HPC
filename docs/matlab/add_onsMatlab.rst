Add-ons
=======

.. admonition:: MATLAB add-ons and environments
   
   - MATLAB **add-ons broaden the use of MATLAB** considerably! 
   - Instead of writing code yourself there may be others that have done the same!
   - Isolated environments solve a couple of problems:

      - You can install specific, also older, versions into them.
      - You can create one for each project and no problem if the two projects require different versions.
      - You can remove the environment and create a new one, if not needed or with errors.
   
.. questions::

   - How to install add-ons?
   - How to work with isolated environments?
   - How to check for and use the UPPMAX pre-installed add-ons?
   
.. admonition:: **Learning outcomes**
   
   - Be able to find installed add-ons
   - Be able to install new add-ons

- Before going into installing add-ons let's have a background to the MATLAB environments and ecosystem!

MATLAB Add-Ons manager
----------------------
In the GUI, the Add-Ons manager can be selected from the menu at the top. The drop-down menu options allow users to:
   - **Browse a library of Add-Ons to download.** Note that some Add-Ons require a separate license.
   - **Manage Add-Ons already downloaded.**
   - Package user-generated code as a Toolbox or App
   - Get hardware-related support packages
Here we will only focus on the first two options.

What is installed at the centres
--------------------------------

- UPPMAX
- HPC2N
- LUNARC

Exercises
---------

1. Use an add-on
2. Install a package
