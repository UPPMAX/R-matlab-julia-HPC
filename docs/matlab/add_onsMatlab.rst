Add-Ons
=======

.. admonition:: MATLAB Add-Ons and environments
   
   - MATLAB **Add-Ons broaden the use of MATLAB** cOnsiderably! 
   - Instead of writing code yourself there may be others that have done the same!
   - Isolated environments solve a couple of problems:

      - You can install specific, also older, versiOns into them.
      - You can create one for each project and no problem if the two projects require different versiOns.
      - You can remove the environment and create a new one, if not needed or with errors.
   
.. questiOns::

   - How to install Add-Ons?
   - How to work with isolated environments?
   - How to check for and use the UPPMAX pre-installed Add-ns?
   

.. objectives:: 

   - Give a general *theoretical* introduction to isolated environments 
   - Show how to install own Add-Ons
   - Show how to check for MATLAB Add-Ons at UPPMAX
   
- Before going into installing Add-Ons let's have a background to the MATLAB environments and ecosystem!

MATLAB Add-Ons manager
----------------------
In the GUI, the Add-Ons manager can be selected from the menu at the top. The drop-down menu optiOns allow users to:
   - **Browse a library of Add-Ons to download.** Note that some Add-Ons require a separate license.
   - **Manage Add-Ons already downloaded.**
   - Package user-generated code as a Toolbox or App
   - Get hardware-related support packages
Here we will only focus on the first two optiOns.
