The Slurm job scheduler and MATLAB
==================================

.. questions::

   - What is a batch job?
   - How to make a batch for MATLAB?
   
.. objectives:: 

   - Understand and use the Slurm scheduler
   - Start batch jobs from MATLAB Graphical User Interface
   - Try example

.. warning::

   Any longer, resource-intensive, or parallel jobs must be run through a **batch script**.

The batch system used at UPPMAX, HPC2N, and LUNARC is called SLURM. The same is the case at most of the Swedish HPC centres. 

SLURM is an Open Source job scheduler, which provides three key functions:

- Keeps track of available system resources
- Enforces local system resource usage and job scheduling policies
- Manages a job queue, distributing work across resources according to policies

.. note:: 

   - If you have attended the other days you have learned that you ask for compute resources via the sbatch command.
       - In order to run a batch job, you need to create and submit a SLURM submit file (also called a batch submit file, a batch script, or a job script).
       - Guides and documentation at: https://docs.hpc2n.umu.se/documentation/batchsystem/intro/ and https://docs.uppmax.uu.se/cluster_guides/slurm/  
   - MATLAB is well integrated with SLURM and because of that there are several ways to run these jobs:
       - Using the job scheduler (``batch`` command) in MATLAB Desktop/graphical interface (This is the Recommended Use).
       - Starting a ``parpool`` with a predefined cluster (This allows for more interactivity).
       - Writing a batch script as for any other software and submitting the job with the ``sbatch`` command from SLURM 
         (This could be useful if you want to run long jobs and you don't need to modify the code in the meantime).
   - In the following sections we will extend these concepts. 

First time configuration
------------------------

In order to be able to submit jobs to the SLURM queue, you need to configure MATLAB:

.. admonition:: Follow these instructions to configure MATLAB

   - `HPC2N <https://www.hpc2n.umu.se/resources/software/configure-matlab-2018>`_
   - `UPPMAX <https://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/matlab/#first-time-since-may-13-2024>`_
   - `LUNARC <https://lunarc-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/applications/MATLAB/#configuration-at-the-command-line>`_



MATLAB Desktop/graphical interface
----------------------------------

   MATLAB GUI




.. admonition:: Content

   - start scripts where needed (configCluster.sh)
   - overview of GUI and jobs
   - ``c.parcluster``
   - ``c.AdditionalProperties.``
   - ``c.batch``
   - ...

   

.. warning::

   - On the login-nodes MATLAB MUST be started with the option '-singleCompThread', preventing MATLAB from using more than one thread.
   - ``parpool`` can only be used on UPPMAX and Cosmos.
  
Useful commands to the batch system
-----------------------------------

- Submit job: ``sbatch <jobscript.sh>``
- Get list of your jobs: ``squeue -u <username>``
- Check on a specific job: ``scontrol show job <job-id>``
- Delete a specific job: ``scancel <job-id>``
- Useful info about a job: ``sacct -l -j <job-id> | less -S``
- Url to a page with info about the job (Kebnekaise only): ``job-usage <job-id>``

Exercises
---------

.. keypoints::

   - **FIX**
   - The SLURM scheduler handles allocations to the calculation nodes
   - Batch jobs runs without interaction with user
   - A batch script consists of a part with SLURM parameters describing the allocation and a second part describing the actual work within the job, for instance one or several Python scripts.
      
      - Remember to include possible input arguments to the Python script in the batch script.
