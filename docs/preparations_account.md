# Preparations of course project

!!! info

    Before the course, you must have done these three things:

    - Prerequisite 1/3: You have registered at our [registration form](https://www.hpc2n.umu.se/events/courses/2025/fall/r-matlab-julia).
    - Prerequisite 2/3: You are part of the course project and have a
    user account in a cluster and are able to log in. **This material**
    - Prerequisite 3/3: You have a good Zoom setup.
    - Also, be a bit prepared about Linux environment and some basics
    of the languages we will cover. See the Prerequistes page](prereqs.md)

## Course project

As part of the hands-on, you will be given temporary access to a course project, which will be used for running the hands-on examples. There are some policies regarding this, that we ask that you follow:

a. You may be given access to the project before the course; please do not use the allocation for running your own codes in. Usage of the project before the course means the priority of jobs submitted to it goes down, diminishing the opportunity for you and your fellow participants to run the examples during the course.

b.  The course project will be open 1-2 weeks after the course, giving the participants the opportunity to test run examples and shorter codes related to the course. During this time, we ask that you only use it for running course related jobs. Use your own discretion, but it could be: (modified) examples from the hands-on, short personal codes that have been modified to test things learned at the course, etc.

!!! info "Policies"

    Anyone found to be misusing the course project, using up large amounts
    of the allocation for their own production runs,
    will be removed from the course project.

!!! warning "Start preparing early"

    Start preparing early!

    The process of getting an account can take several days,
    due to some waiting steps.
