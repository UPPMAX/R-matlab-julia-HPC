# Preparations of course project

## Course project 

As part of the hands-on, you will be given temporary access to a course project, which will be used for running the hands-on examples. There are some policies regarding this, that we ask that you follow:

a. You may be given access to the project before the course; please do not use the allocation for running your own codes in. Usage of the project before the course means the priority of jobs submitted to it goes down, diminishing the opportunity for you and your fellow participants to run the examples during the course.

b.  The course project will be open 1-2 weeks after the course, giving the participants the opportunity to test run examples and shorter codes related to the course. During this time, we ask that you only use it for running course related jobs. Use your own discretion, but it could be: (modified) examples from the hands-on, short personal codes that have been modified to test things learned at the course, etc.

!!! info Policies

    Anyone found to be misusing the course project, using up large amounts of the allocation for their own production runs, will be removed from the course project. 

!!! warning "Start preparing early"

    Start preparing early!

    The process of getting an account can take several days,
    due to some waiting steps.

## What to do

Before the course, you must have done these three things:

- Prerequisite 1/3: You have registered at our registration form.
- Prerequisite 2/3: You are part of the course project and have a user account in a cluster and are able tro log in.
- Prerequisite 3/3: You have a good Zoom setup.

It is also of big value that you have basic knowledge in these topics



## Registration Form



## I not already, register in SUPR

## Ask for access to a NAISS course project

Choose a cluster where you already work today. 
If you are a beginner and have no cluster resources yet, we recommend Tetralith at NSC.

## Working in Linux environment

- On your HPC cluster, you can:
    - Use a text editor, for example, ``nano``


<!-- 

RJCB: I think this is misleading:
learners perfectly get away with this,
as we teachers tell all they need to know.
I think these study prerequirements do more damage than good.

These are the things you need to follow the course:

- You have a basic understanding of what an HPC cluster is.
  To get familiar with HPC clusters,
  see [our material on HPC clusters](common/hpc_clusters.md)
- You are not a complete beginner of the Linux environment.
  To get familiar with the Linux/Bash command line,
  we recommend the courses and material at
  [our collection of other courses](common/other_courses.md)
