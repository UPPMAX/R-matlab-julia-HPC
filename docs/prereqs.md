    Start preparing early!

    The process of getting an account can take several days,
    due to some waiting steps.


<!-- 

RJCB: I think this is misleading:
learners perfectly get away with this,
as we teachers tell all they need to know.
I think these study prerequirements do more damage than good.

These are the things you need to follow the course:

- You have a basic understanding of what an HPC cluster is.
  To get familiar with HPC clusters,
  see [our material on HPC clusters](common/hpc_clusters.md)
- You are not a complete beginner of the Linux environment.
  To get familiar with the Linux/Bash command line,
  we recommend the courses and material at
  [our collection of other courses](common/other_courses.md)
