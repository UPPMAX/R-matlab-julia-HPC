What is python?
---------------

As you probably already know…
    
    - “Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax.
    - It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. 
    - There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. …“

In particular, what sets Python apart from other languages is its fantastic
open-source ecosystem for scientific computing and machine learning with
libraries like NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn and Pytorch.

Material for improving your programming skills
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

First level
...........

`The Carpentries <https://carpentries.org/>`_  teaches basic lab skills for research computing.

- `Programming with Python <https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/)>`_ 

- `Plotting and Programming in Python <http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/>`_ 

Second level
::::::::::::

CodeRefinery develops and maintains training material on software best practices for researchers that already write code. Their material addresses all academic disciplines and tries to be as programming language-independent as possible. 

- `Lessons <https://coderefinery.org/lessons/)>`_ 
- `Data visualization using Python <https://coderefinery.github.io/data-visualization-python/>`_

- `Python for Scientific Computing <https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/>`_ 

   - `Introduction to packages <https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/dependencies/>`_ 


Third level
:::::::::::

`ENCCS (EuroCC National Competence Centre Sweden) <https://enccs.se/>`_ is a national centre that supports industry, public administration and academia accessing and using European supercomputers. They give higher-level training of programming and specific software.

- `High Performance Data Analytics in Python <https://enccs.github.io/hpda-python/)>`_

- The youtube video `Thinking about Concurrency <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv25Dwe84g0>`_ is a good introduction to writing concurrent programs in Python 

- The book `High Performance Python <https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/high-performance-python/9781492055013/>`_ is a good resource for ways of speeding up Python code.

.. objectives:: 

    We will:
    
    - Teach you how to navigate the module system at UPPMAX (and HPC2N)
    - Show you how to find out which versions of Python and packages are installed
    - Look at the package handler **pip** (and **Conda** for UPPMAX)
    - Explain how to create and use virtual environments
    - Show you how to run batch jobs 
    - Show some examples with parallel computing and using GPUs
