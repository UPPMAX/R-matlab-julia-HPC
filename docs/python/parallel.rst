What is parallel programming?
-----------------------------

Parallel programming is the art of writing code that execute tasks on different
computing units (cores) simultaneously. In the past computers were shiped with a
single core per Central Processing Unit (CPU) and therefore it could only perform
a single computation at the time (serial program).

Nowadays computer architechures are more complex than the single core CPU mentioned
already. For instance, common architectures include those where several cores in a
CPU share a common memory space and also those where CPUs are connected through some
network interconnect.

A more realistic picture of a computer architecture can be seen in the following 
picture where we have 14 cores that shared a common memory of 64 GB. These cores
form the socket and the two sockets shown in this picture constitute a node.

It is interesting to notice that there are different types of memory that are
available for the cores, ranging from the L1 cache to the node's memory for a single
node. In the former, the bandwidth can be TB/s while in the latter GB/s.

Now you can see that on a single node you already have several computing units
(cores) and also a hierarchy of memory resources.

Why is parallel programming needed?
-----------------------------------

There is no "free lunch" when trying to use features (computing/memory resources) in
modern architectures. If you want your code to be aware of those features, you will
need to either add them explicitly (by coding them yourself) or implicitly (by using
libraries that were coded by others).

In your local machine, you may have some number of cores available and some memory 
attached to them which can be exploited by using a parallell program. There can be
some limited resources for running your data-production simulations as you may use
your local machine for other purposes such as writing a manuscript, making a presentation,
...  One
