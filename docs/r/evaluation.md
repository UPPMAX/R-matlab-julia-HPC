# Evaluation

The evaluation form for the R part can be found [here](https://forms.office.com/e/jDAQWiPbgs).
It takes into account that one may need to leave early too.

This is the page for evaluating the current iteration of the course.

???- hint "Where can I find the results of earlier evaluations?"

    At [the 'Evaluations' page](../evaluations/README.md).

<!-- Not today

## Any feedback during the day

- `Form to submit any feedback during the day`

???- hint "For teachers: what is in that form?"

    Thanks for your feedback.
    This feedback will be published as-is at the end of the day,
    if and only if there are no personal details (email, address, etc.)
    in the feedback.
    Do mention the teachers, assistants, etc by name!

## Evaluation questions

- [Evaluation questions form](https://forms.office.com/e/jDAQWiPbgs)

???- hint "Why do you evaluate under lesson hours?"

    Because we value your time: your free time should be your free time.

    We think the time lost teaching is worth it to improve our teaching.
