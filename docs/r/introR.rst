   .. tab:: Learning objectives

      - see a first overview of the R programming language
      - see the overview of the course

   .. tab:: For teachers

      Teaching goals are:

      - Learners have seen an overview of the course
      - Learners have seen an first overview of the R programming language

      Lesson plan (20 minutes in total):

      - 5 mins: prior knowledge
         - What is R?
         - Why use R?
         - What are features of R?
         - Can R do everything?
         - What are R packages?
      - 5 mins: presentation: First overview of R
      - 5 mins: presentation: Course schedule
      - 5 mins: feedback

. admonition:: **Course learning objectives**
 
   - use the module system to load R
   - use the module system to load site-installed R packages
   - find out which versions of R and packages are installed
   - run R scripts
   - write a batch script for running R
   - install R packages from CRAN
   - see how to install other R packages yourself
   - start batch jobs 
   - run RStudion

   on HPC2N or UPPMAX

. admonition:: **Course non-goals**

   - improve R coding skills 
   - use R on other HPC clusters

First overview of R
-------------------

R is a programming language for statistical computing and data visualization
(from `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language>`_).

The main general R resources are:

- `The R homepage <https://www.r-project.org/>`_
- `The official R documentation <https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html>`_
- `The CRAN homepage <https://cran.r-project.org/>`_(with `a list of CRAN mirrors <https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html>`_)

R is used in many NAISS centres:

- `here is an overview of 6 NAISS centres and their R documentation <http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/r/#overview-of-naiss-centers-and-their-documentation-about-r>`_
- `here is an (incomplete) overview of R courses being taught at NAISS <http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/r/#learning-r>`_
