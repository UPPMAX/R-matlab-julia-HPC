Introduction
------------

.. mermaid:: load_run_r_overview.mmd 

To allow us to work with R on an HPC cluster, we will:

- find the module to be able to run R, 
  so we know which versions of R we can pick from
- load the module to be able to run R,
  so we can actually run R
- run the R interpreter, so we can test/develop R code
- run an R script from the command-line, so we can run R code

In this session, we will follow this typical user journey.

1. Find an R module
-------------------

To be able to work with R on an HPC cluster, 
we will need to find a module that loads a specific version of R.

HPC2N and UPPMAX use the same module system:

- `the HPC2N documentation of the module system <https://www.hpc2n.umu.se/documentation/environment/lmod>`_
- `the UPPMAX documentation of the module system <http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/cluster_guides/modules/>`_

HPC2N and UPPMAX do differ how their module systems show results when searching for a module:

- HPC2N: a module is hidden from search until a prerequisite module is loaded
- UPPMAX: when searching for a module, one can always see all modules

Here is how to find the R modules of all versions:

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: UPPMAX

        From a terminal, do:

        .. code-block:: console
 
           $ module spider R

        .. admonition:: How does the output look like ?
            :class: dropdown
    
            The output will look similar to this output
            (run at UPPMAX on October 15 2023):

            .. code-block::  tcl

                [bbrydsoe@rackham3 bbrydsoe]$ module spider R

                ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  For detailed information about a specific "R" package (including how to load the modules) use the module's full name.
                  Note that names that have a trailing (E) are extensions provided by other modules.
                  For example:

                -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is how to find out how to load an R module of a specific version:

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: UPPMAX

        To see how to load a specific version of R, including the prerequisites, do 

        .. code-block:: console
   
            $ module spider R/<version>

         where ``<version>`` is an R version, in ``major.minor.patch`` format, 
         for example, ``module spider R/4.1.2``


    .. tab:: HPC2N
   
        To see how to load a specific version of R, including the prerequisites, do 

        .. code-block:: console
   
            $ module spider R/<version>

         where ``<version>`` is an R version, in ``major.minor.patch`` format, 
         for example, ``module spider R/4.1.2``


2. Load an R module
-------------------

- For reproducibility reasons, you should always load a specific version of a module instead of just the default version
- Many modules have prerequisite modules which needs to be loaded first (at HPC2N this is also the case for the R modules). When doing ``module spider <module>/<version>`` you will get a list of which other modules needs to be loaded first

!!! important

  - For reproducibility, we recommend ALWAYS loading a specific module instead of using the default version! 
  -  For this course, we recommend using ``R/4.1.1`` on UPPMAX clusters and ``4.1.2`` on Kebnekaise

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: UPPMAX

        To load version 4.1.1, do:

        .. code-block:: console

            module load R/4.1.1        

    .. tab:: HPC2N

        .. code-block:: console

            module load GCC/10.2.0 OpenMPI/4.0.5 R/4.1.2

.. warning::

   + UPPMAX: Donâ€™t use system-installed R/3.6.0
   + HPC2N: No system installed R 
   + ALWAYS use R module


3. Run the R interpreter
------------------------

.. type-along::

   - After loading the R module (and its prerequisites), you start R like this:
	- The output from below is from an older version

Exit R with ``q()`` in the R prompt. Decide if you want to save your workspace image or not. 


   .. code-block:: console

      $ R

      > 

   .. code-block:: rconsole

      > 4+7
      [1] 11
      > j=4+7
      > j
      [1] 11
      > a=3
      > b=7
      > c=a+b
      > c
      [1] 10

4. Run an R script
------------------

You can run an R script in the bash shell like this:

.. code-block:: console

   $ Rscript example.R

.. warning::

   *only* run jobs that are short and/or do not use a lot of resources from the command line. Otherwise ALWAYS use the batch system!
    
   More information will follow on running R from within a **batch job**. 

.. type-along::

   Here is an example of running a short, serial R program at Kebnekaise: 

   .. admonition:: Serial R program (add2.R) to add two arguments
      :class: dropdown

      .. code-block:: R
        
         
         args <- commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE)
         num1 <- as.numeric(args[1])
         num2 <- as.numeric(args[2])
            
         answer <- num1 + num2
         cat("Sum of arguments is: ", answer)
         cat("\n")
           
           
   .. code-block:: console

      $ Rscript add2.R 3 4
       Sum of arguments is:  7
      $


.. admonition:: Workflow

   In addition to loading R, you will also often need to (install and) use own-installed R packages. The work-flow would be something like this: 
    
   1) Load R and prerequisites: ``module load <pre-reqs> R/<version>``
   2) Check which extensions your R version has. They are generally listed under "Extensions" when you do: 
   
      - ``module spider R/<version>``. 
      - Otherwise, you can do ``installed.packages()`` from within R. 
      - NOTE that the latter option generates a LOT of output, but also gives versions of the R packages (Extensions, as they are called by the module system). 
      
   3) Install any extra R packages you need (optional): 
    
      - Automatical download and install: ``R --quiet --no-save --no-restore -e "install.packages('<r-package>', repos='http://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/CRAN/')"`` 
      - Manual download and install: ``R CMD INSTALL -l <path-to-R-package>/R-package.tar.gz``
    
   4) 
    
      - Start R: ``R``
      - run ``Rscript <program.R>``
      - batch job for R program: ``sbatch <my-R-batch-job.sh>``

   - Installed R packages can be accessed within R with ``library("package")`` as usual. 

   - The command ``installed.packages()`` given within R will list the available packages to import. 

   - More about installing your own R packages to follow in later sections of the course! 

Exercises
---------

Exercise 1: load an R module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Exercise 2: run the R interpreter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. challenge:: Try yourself to load R, start it, check libraries, load a library, quit R
    
   .. code-block:: R
   
      1) Load R version 4.1.X 
      2) Start R. Check which libraries are installed. Load one of them.
      3) Quit R
	
   Remember to check if a module you are loading has prerequisites, and load those first if it does. In this case it depends on whether you do the exercises on Kebnekaise or Rackham.

	    As you can see above, the main differences here compared to Rackham is that you need to load some prerequisites before you can load R and that doing ``ml spider R/<version>`` will give you a long list of "extensions" which is what the module system calls the system installed R packages. 
 	    

Exercise 3: run an R script

.. admonition:: Exercise files

    - You can download the (files of the) exercises from the course GitHub repo, 
      under the "Exercises" directory:
      https://github.com/UPPMAX/R-python-julia-HPC/tree/main/Exercises
    - On HPC2N, you can copy the exercises in a tarball 
      from ``/proj/nobackup/hpc2n2024-025/Exercises.tar.gz``
    - On UPPMAX you can copy the exercises in a tarball 
      from ``/proj/naiss2024-22-107/Exercises.tar.gz``

.. challenge:: Download the exercise files

    Download the exercise files on your favorite cluster.


.. challenge:: Load R and run a short R script from the command line
    
    .. code-block:: sh
    
        1) Load R version 4.1.X (if you have not done so already)
	2) Run the small R script called ``hello.R``, using ``Rscript``
	
    Remember to check if a module you are loading has prerequisites, and load those first if it does. In this case it depends on whether you do the exercises on Kebnekaise or Rackham. 

   .. admonition:: "hello.R" (it can also be found under "R" in the "Exercises" directory on the course GitHub repository (https://github.com/UPPMAX/R-python-julia-HPC). 

      .. code-block:: R
      
         message <-"Hello World!"
        print(message)

      .. tab:: UPPMAX
 
            This is for Rackham.
          
            .. code-block:: console
	    
	       [bbrydsoe@rackham2 bbrydsoe]$ Rscript hello.R
	       [1] "Hello World!"
	       [bbrydsoe@rackham2 bbrydsoe]$

      .. tab:: HPC2N
 
            This is for Kebnekaise. 
          
            .. code-block:: sh
	    
	       b-an01 [~]$ Rscript hello.R
	       [1] "Hello World!"
	       b-an01 [~]$ 

	    
      As you can see, it is working the same. 
      

Module system cheat sheet
-------------------------

- See which modules are currently loaded: ``module list``
- See which modules exists: ``module spider`` or ``module spider``
- Find module versions for a particular software: ``module spider <software>``
- Modules depending only on what is currently loaded: ``module avail``
- Load a module: ``module load <module>/<version>``
- Unload a module: ``module unload <module>/<version>``
- More information about a module: ``module show <module>/<version>``
- Unload all modules except the 'sticky' modules: ``module purge``

Conclusions
-----------

.. keypoints::

    You need to:

   - first find a module to run R
   - load one or more modules to run R. 
       - if you care about reproducibility, use explicit versions
   - start the R interpreter with ``R``
   - run R scripts scripts with ``Rscript``
