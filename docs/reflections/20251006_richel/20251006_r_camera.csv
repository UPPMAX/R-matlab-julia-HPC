Suggestions/ideas:

- What did you like best? (materials, exercises, structure)
- Where should we improve? (materials, exercises, structure) 
- Training organiza",,awesome material and good that you record but could you record during the lectures all of you so we get the exact thing that is thought? i'm also not fond of having to have the camera on which i felt there was pressure to do so i watched most after the course instead
