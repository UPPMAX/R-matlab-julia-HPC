# Reflection

I was ill in the morning. I was ill already for a week and hence
was more absent from all team discussions.

## Teaching 9:00 First login

There were 5 visitors. Me and the team were able to help all of them.
I've helped 1 learner and it was a good experience: she was a complete
beginner and at the end of my, around 15 minutes, help, she
was super ready.

## Teaching 10:00 Load modules and run

There were 6 learners. Most time was spent with the 1 learner
that did not attend the login session.

When ill, my talking is slower. A good thing. However, due to the constant
pain, I do not enjoy my teaching sessions as usual.

I did meet all students properly. At 10:47 2 (out of 6) were done: I sent them
on an earlier break. 

## Teaching 14:00 RStudio

Me and a colleague split up the learners:
the colleague offered to help, as it was unsure
how well I was (as I was less response in chat,
due to -indeed- illness). I think it is nice
to get unexpected help and I think it is
a good idea that she had a 1-on-1 with 'her'
COSMOS users. So, we split up, after announcing
this in the main room.

I was very happy to see my learners again. We
were with 3, 1 that used Sigma, and 2 that used
Dardel. I started with the Sigma user,
as (1) she has no documentation, 
and (2) Dardel has Open OnDemand, which is easier.
I did so after discussing this with the whole group.

When the Sigma user was in the system (for the
first time), I told her to try a bit for herself,
so I could talk to the Dardel users. We agreed.

I disturbed the Dardel users. They were already done.
I told them that in 5 minutes I will give a bit
more in-depth demo about RStudio, after helping
the Sigma user (which I estimated to cost that
long). The Dardel users agreed.

The Sigma user was in quickly, so we started talking
as a class again. I did my demo on RStudio,
until it was time again to back to the main room.

I remember from earlier reflections that
I should not be too informal, and I think
I succeeded reasonably (but not perfectly)
well: it felt too nice to have them back :-)

## 15:00 Summary and Evaluation

I went through the summary. What was missing
was a list of other course.

- [x] Add link to SCoRe list of courses

The evaluation was clean: I told them why I
put them in breakout rooms. One out of six
learners came back to ask his questions, which
I discussed in a breakout room.

## Predictions

My sessions went very well:

- In the 'Load modules and run' session,
  I have seen all run the R interpreter
- In the RStudio session,
  I have seen all run RStudio

## Evaluation results

- [My success score](../../evaluations/20251006_r/succes_score_richel.txt): 75%

The only useful item is 'Do you have any additional comments?':

- I liked the online material about how to prepare and get everything set up,
  which has been my main issue so far.
  Unfortunately I could not initially run R via the terminal/ssh,
  so I couldn't do the practicals on batch,
  but I am sure I can figure it out myself.
- no
- no
- awesome material and good that you record but could you record during
  the lectures all of you so we get the exact thing that is thought?
  i'm also not fond of having to have the camera on
  which i felt there was pressure to do
  so i watched most after the course instead
