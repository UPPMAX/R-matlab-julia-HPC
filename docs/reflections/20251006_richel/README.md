# Reflection

I was ill in the morning. I was ill already for a week and hence
was more absent from all team discussions.

## Teaching 9:00 First login

There were 5 visitors. Me and the team were able to help all of them.
I've helped 1 learner and it was a good experience: she was a complete
beginner and at the end of my, around 15 minutes, help, she
was super ready.

## Teaching 10:00 Load modules and run

There were 6 learners. Most time was spent with the 1 learner
that did not attend the login session.

When ill, my talking is slower. A good thing. However, due to the constant
pain, I do not enjoy my teaching sessions as usual.

I did meet all students properly. At 10:47 2 (out of 6) were done: I sent them
on an earlier break. 

## Teaching 14:00 RStudio

Me and a colleague split up the learners:
the colleague offered to help, as it was unsure
how well I was (as I was less response in chat,
due to -indeed- illness). I think it is nice
to get unexpected help and I think it is
a good idea that she had a 1-on-1 with 'her'
COSMOS users. So, we split up, after announcing
this in the main room.

I was very happy to see my learners again. We
were with 3, 1 that used Sigma, and 2 that used
Dardel. I started with the Sigma user,
as (1) she has no documentation, 
and (2) Dardel has Open OnDemand, which is easier.
I did so after discussing this with the whole group.

When the Sigma user was in the system (for the
first time), I told her to try a bit for herself,
so I could talk to the Dardel users. We agreed.

I disturbed the Dardel users. They were already done.
I told them that in 5 minutes I will give a bit
more in-depth demo about RStudio, after helping
the Sigma user (which I estimated to cost that
long). The Dardel users agreed.

The Sigma user was in quickly, so we started talking
as a class again. I did my demo on RStudio,
until it was time again to back to the main room.

I remember from earlier reflections that
I should not be too informal, and I think
I succeeded reasonably (but not perfectly)
well: it felt too nice to have them back :-)

## 15:00 Summary and Evaluation

I went through the summary. What was missing
was a list of other course.

The evaluation was clean: I told them why I
put them in breakout rooms. One out of six
learners came back to ask his questions, which
I discussed in a breakout room.

## Predictions

My sessions went very well:

- In the 'Load modules and run' session,
  I have seen all run the R interpreter
- In the RStudio session,
  I have seen all run RStudio
