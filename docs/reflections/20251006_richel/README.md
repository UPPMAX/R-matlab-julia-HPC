I was ill in the morning. I was ill already for a week and hence
was more absent from all team discussions.

## Teaching 9:00

There were 5 visitors. Me and the team were able to help all of them.
I've helped 1 learner and it was a good experience: she was a complete
beginner and at the end of my, around 15 minutes, help, she
was super ready.

## Teaching 10:00

There were 6 learners. Most time was spent with the 1 learner
that did not attend the login session.

When ill, my talking is slower. A good thing. However, due to the constant
pain, I do not enjoy my teaching sessions as usual.

I did meet all students properly. At 10:47 2 (out of 6) were done: I sent them
on an earlier break.
