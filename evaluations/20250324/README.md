- 8.25

![Question 2 results](question_2_results.png)

- The pace was different for the different for the different modules
- Extremely helpful day, and the exercises were generally
  very well prepared and pedagogic
- A good general overview of how to run R in HPC.
  By the end it was a bit long but it clarified a lot
  of concepts for me
- It was good!
- I am happy with the pace
- Good
- For me, it was a little too fast
- The pace is very appropriate, although I couldn't really
  follow the ML part as it was out of my area of expertise

- 8x Yes

![Question 5 results](question_5_results.png)

- More on parallelizing in R
- It would be nice to perhaps have a little module on transferring
  files to and from the server: while I feel pretty confident about
  using R, I'm not completelt sure how to get files to and from
  he server. And secondly, I'm 99% sure it should be reasonably
  straightforward, but it might be nice for there to be a little
  extra note on best practices for installing and using STAN
  for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). R, Julia and MATLAB can work
  with STAN, and because MCMC is such a slow process, I can
  imagine that this could be helpful.
