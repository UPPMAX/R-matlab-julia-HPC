## [comments.txt](comments.txt)

- The course material is excellent. However, it is not necessary that someone reads it in real time in a zoom meeting, and the level of interaction in the zoom meeting has been low. I could just as well have gone through the course material in my own pace at a time that suited me and learned almost as much (my background is that I know some Linux, Matlab, and cluster batch job submission from before).
