Very happy there was a session on using matlab from the terminal since we need that and also submit batch jobs which is rarely covered otherwise. Thanx!",I absolutely can do this!,I absolutely can do this!,I absolutely can do this!,I absolutely can do this!,I absolutely can do this!,I absolutely can do this!,I absolutely can do this!,I absolutely can do this!,I have good confidence I can do this,I have good confidence I can do this,I did not attend that session,I have no confidence I can do this,I did not attend that session,Yes,parallel matlab batch scripts,you have made some really great material. thanx for recording - i didn't feel well to follow the course live so it was good to be able to watch later. I also look forward to watch the advanced session when will that be up?
