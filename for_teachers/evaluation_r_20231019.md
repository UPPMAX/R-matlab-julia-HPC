# R evaluation 2023-10-19

 * Number of learners: 12

Feedback:

 * 2x The course is well organized!
 * Teachers do not distinguish enough between the different UPPMAX
   clusters on the first day, however, this was fixed on day 3 :-)
 * Day 3 was slightly better than Day 1 (both were good!), 
   with the advice: on Day 1, take more for ThinLinc and interactive
 * Everything was quite good, especially SLURM, 
   better than some other UPPMAX course.
   This was mostly due to, today, doing exercises step by step and having
   enough time to follow
 * ThinLinc was of correct length today, on Day 1 indeed a little bit too short
 * All the instructors should use the same R version, because
   else you need to load a different R module
