What went well:

 * [W1] Working as a team
 * [W2] All students (that could log in) completed their exercises within time
 * [W3] We tried out something new: a new format for the evaluation
 * [W4] Collecting feedback during the lessons
 * [W5] Using a shared document

What could be improved:

 * [I1] Lengths of the course parts
 * [I2] Remember to schedule a moment for all students to help them log in
 * [I3] Evaluation before Q&A
 * [I4] Install Python package: actually install something in the demo
 * [I5] Me being a good team member
 * [I6] Tell students clearly what to do: observe or type along or do an exercise
 * [I7] No questions in Zoom chat, use shared doc only

To discuss:

 * [D1] Allow students that have not logged in yet?
 * [D2] Shouldn't this material be at the regular UPPMAX website?

## [W1] Working as a team

I was very happy to be part of this team of Birgitte, Björn and Pedro,
as its members seems quite diverse: 

 * Birgitte: most knowledge of general things
 * Björn: the most all-around-nice-guy
 * Pedro: most knowledgeable in parallel computing

As Björn was the only one to have sysadmin rights,
he was the one to get learners to login, which he did as much as he could.

Both Birgitte and Björn impressed me by answering complex questions
during lectures!

Also, already after the lecture, me and Björn discussed how to improve
the course next time. We especially discussed learners that could not 
log in. Björn stated there are good reasons to allow these learners
to participate in the course, so we chose not to disallow these.
Instead, we think it would be a good idea to have a moment scheduled
for the learners before the course, for those that could not log in yet.

## [W2] All students (that could log in) completed their exercises within time

Between 10:00-10:45, all students (that could log in) 
had completed their exercises at 10:15.

Between 11:00-11:45, all students (that could log in) 
had completed their exercises at 11:30. Due to a request by Birgitte,
they had to create another venv, which they then all did within a
couple of minutes too.

At 13:30-13:45, I'd have had 15 mins to do Jupyter notebook on Rackham,
which was moved to 13:45-13:55. I felt 15 mins would have been enough,
10 mins was too short.

At 14:00-14:25, I and the Rackham learners did an exercises on `interactive`
and conda. I think it was enough time. Note that creating a new conda environment
takes 13 minutes, which I used to talk about Python things with the learners.

## [W3] We tried out something new: a new format for the evaluation

I am happy that the team tried out a new format for the evaluation.
Already at the end of the day, we discussed already the pros and
cons of it and we'll try out another format directly the
day after!

## [W4] Collecting feedback during the lessons

During the exercises, I went through the Zoom rooms to check
that all students knew what to do, had questions and/or have remarks.

Also the shared document helped to collect feedback during the lesson.

## [W5] Using a shared document

The shared document helped to collect questions and feedback during the lesson.

## [I1] Lengths of the course parts

Topic   |Was scheduled|Actual time used|Suggested time
--------|-------------|----------------|--------------
packages|45 mins      |15 mins         | 30 mins
venv    |45 mins      |15 mins         | 30 mins
Jupyter |15 mins      |15 mins         | 15 mins
conda   |25 mins      |25 mins         | 30 mins

I/we could not predict the lengths of the topics.
For 'packages' and 'venv', the learners had much time left.
It is unsure if that is due to (1) me having too simple
exercises, (2) my way of teaching compared to the previous
time (but it is unclear in which way it differed) (3) the learners were
quicker too learn this time. Maybe next time, we'll find out :-)

## [I2] Remember to schedule a moment for all students to help them log in

There were 4 students out of 28 that could not log in yet.
Although they behaved well,
it took away time of other students.
Björn stated there are good reasons to allow these learners
to participate in the course.
However, we forgot to schedule a moment for the learners 
to log in before the course.

## [I3] Evaluation before Q&A
## [I4] Install Python package: actually install something in the demo
## [I5] Me being a good team member
## [I6] Tell students clearly what to do: observe or type along or do an exercise
## [I7] No questions in Zoom chat, use shared doc only
