This means I can add 50 minutes. Here I distribute these from the notes:

Topic                                      |Current duration (mins)
-------------------------------------------|---------------
Syllabus                                   |10
Python in general                          |10
Load modules and run                       |25 + 5
Packages                                   |30
Isolated environments (ML, venv, **conda**)|60
Batch                                      |20 + 10
GPU                                        |10 + 10
Kebnekaise: Jupyter                        |15 + 15
Rackham: Interactive session and Jupyter   |. (parallel with Kebnekaise)
Parallel and multithreaded functions       |25 + 10
Total                                      |205 + 50 = 255

Now fitting this into this decided schedule:

Simultaneous session:
- Kebnekaise: Jupyter, by BB
- Rackham:  Interactive session and Jupyter, by RB
- LUNARC, by RP

Discussion points:

- For this schedules, breaks were scheduled first, so that
  (1) schedule is simple, and (2) all session lengths are 45 or 60 mins.
  However, assuming all durations are correct (!), some sessions will be
  cut by a break. Is that acceptable?
  - If yes: no problemo
  - No: where should the breaks be instead? Who makes a new schedule?
- I picked to discuss batch (by BB) from 13:35-14:05, 
  over having a break at 14:00 and having a 5 minute session
  with a schedule like below. Agreed?

Time       |Topic                                                 |Teacher
-----------|------------------------------------------------------|-------
13:35-14:00|Batch 25/30 mins                                      |BB
14:00-14:15|Break                                                 |.
14:15-14:20|Batch 5/30 mins                                       |BB

- R: There is no time for evaluation at the end. I feel 10 minutes
  is enough and the time is worth it. I suggest to add it.
  - Pro: helps us improve the course, shows we care about our learners' opinion
  - Con: takes time away
  - Vote:
    - Yes:
    - No:
- If evaluation, suggest questions on confidence, 
  see [here](https://github.com/UPPMAX/uppmax_intro_day_1/tree/main/evaluations/20240827)
  - Pro: useful to asses stronger/weaker sessions of the course
  - Con: maybe must use a standard evaluation form, needs teachers to formulate
    their lesson goals
  - Vote:
    - Yes:
    - No:
