## Preparation

Here is the current state of my sessions:

Time  | Topic                   | State
------|-------------------------|------
10:00 | Introduction            |.
10:10 | Syllabus                |.
10:20 | Load modules and run    |.
14:30 | Simultaneous session    |. 
16:00 | Summary and evaluation  |.

- [ ] Next course iteration: make 'Load and run R' point to documentation more

I want to make the course more useful and NAISS-wide, mostly pointing
to documentation.

- [ ] In the next course iteration: use more active learning methods in this
  session

- [ ] In the simultaneous session, stay formal

- [For next time] RB: suggest to make ‘Batch’ 15 minutes longer and remove a session, in the next course iteration

These are the learning outcomes for which I have 45 minutes:

- find the module to be able to run R
- load the module to be able to run R
- run the R interpreter
- run the R command to get the list of installed R packages
- run an R script from the command-line

I will have to simplify things :-) .

Clusters used in the course (as taken from 'The important info about
the course' document):

– COSMOS
- Dardel 
- Kebnekaise 
- Rackham
- Tetralith 




## Evaluation questions

- 1. Overall, how would you rate today's training event?
    - RB: Neutral. I'd prefer to use the average learning outcome
      of question 12.
- 2.Today's content and feedback to the lecturers (e.g. materials, exercises, structure): – What did you like best?
    - RB: Suggest to remove, question 15 is fine for this
- 3.Today's content and feedback to the lecturers (e.g. materials, exercises, structure): – Where should we improve?
    - RB: Suggest to remove, question 15 is fine for this
- 4.Training event organisation (e.g. announcement, registration, ...):  –   What did you like best?      – Where should we improve?
    - RB: Suggest to remove, unless the course coordinator likes this question
- 5.Length of teaching today was
    - RB: Suggest to remove, question 15 is fine for this
- 6.Depth of content was
    - RB: Suggest to remove: there are too many teachers
- 7.The pace of teaching was
    - RB: Suggest to remove: there are too many teachers
- 8.Teaching aids used (e.g. slides) were well prepared
    - RB: Suggest to remove: there are too many teachers
- 9.Hands-on exercises and demonstrations were
    - RB: Suggest to remove: there are too many teachers
- 10.Hands-on exercises and demonstrations were well prepared
    - RB: Suggest to remove: there are too many teachers
- 11.How would you rate the separate sessions?
    - RB: Suggest to remove: this is too harsh on a person
- 12.Give your confidence levels of the following statements
    - RB: Awesome! Love this!
- 13.Did today's course meet your expectation?
    - RB: Suggest to remove: too big overlap with question 1
- 14.Which future training topics would you like to be provided by the training host(s)?
    - RB: Suggest to remove
- 15.Do you have any additional comments?
    - RB: Awesome! Love this!
