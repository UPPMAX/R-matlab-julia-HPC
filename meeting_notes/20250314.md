### Status

- Registrations
    - 42 registrations now
    - Closes on Monday
- Welcome email by reg-closing
- GH pages
    - Can we make this **into an issue**? BB did a first attempt,
      then RB volunteers to fix this
    - mermaid OK?
    - Create website breaks
        - [This commit](https://github.com/UPPMAX/R-matlab-julia-HPC/commit/93f58ccf22eafcfb209ba2c728ec94c5ba822ddf) is the first that caused an error
        - I could just spot that three files were pushed at the same time. we can check the isolated one, yes
        - Error can be found at [here](https://github.com/UPPMAX/R-matlab-julia-HPC/actions/runs/13838365771/job/38719138952#step:8:67)
        - Turns out the error is unrelated to the commit. Instead, [this file](https://github.com/UPPMAX/R-matlab-julia-HPC/blob/main/docs/matlab/local_desktopMatlab.rst) is the actual cause: the word 'admonitions' is (no longer?) accepted. This error has already been fixed.
            - that's fixed and just a warning that it would not render
        - how do you reach /tmp/sphinx-err-2s6whocg.log
            - Add a line to the CI script `create_website.yaml` to `cat` it, e.g.:

```text
- name: Show log
  run: cat /tmp/sphinx-err-2s6whocg.log
```

### Resources

- The `Rmpi` R package does not work on Tetralith: Pedro?
- BC can test other's exercises if necessary, because he has got not many exercises of that kind
    - let him know!
- next time BC/RB apply for UPPMAX project and add our non-UPPMAX colleagues,
  (instead of the other way around)

### Login hour

- Where to discuss to download and extract the tar balls?
    - shown in prereq (votes):
    - [DECIDED] discussed in (optional) login session (votes): BB, BC, PO, RB, RP
    - discussed in the first regular session 'introduction' (votes): RB
- Needs some update:
    - The session is at [here](https://uppmax.github.io/R-matlab-julia-HPC/common/use_tarball.html) and has a video
    - [x] who? BC

### Recording

- Did we decide to do recordings before/after (up to us)??
    - **Teacher decides** whether to (1) pre-record, (2) live record, (3) post-record
        - BB will upload any video :-)
        - [DECIDED] Votes: BB, RB, RP, PO

    - Is it OK with the iframe, like  <https://uppmax.github.io/R-matlab-julia-HPC/matlab/introMatlab.html#schedule>
    - [x] BC removes iframe
        - (in future perhaps just include one of the frames)
- Hide information?
    - Every teacher decides :-)
    - extra?
