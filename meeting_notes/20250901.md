## Meeting 1 Sep 11.00

### Goal

- Schedule
- Someone should make Materials-ReadTheDocs work!
    - RB (from the future, 2025-09-03) [Works](https://github.com/UPPMAX/R-matlab-julia-HPC/issues/221)

### what about batch?

- keep on the earlier days
    - argument: batch and interactive is central on HPC evnen if they are not using and know details of parallelism

- move to Friday?
    - argument: ?? 

### How much time in old slots?

- R
    - [Schedule](https://github.com/UPPMAX/R-matlab-julia-HPC/blob/main/docs-mk/r/schedule.md)
    - RB is happy with the schedule as it is
    - RB is happy with the current amount of topics. If BB wants to modify/extend the schedule, that is fine too :-)
    - batch 1h (keep batch here
        - will be shorter on Monday
        - some material to move
            - ML
            - GPU
    - how much material for Friday
        - parallel
        - use of GPUs 
            - discuss a bit later
- MATLAB
    - [Schedule](https://github.com/UPPMAX/R-matlab-julia-HPC/blob/main/docs-mk/matlab/schedule.md)
    - batch+ some syntax 55 (command line) stay
    - syntax 30 (matlab GUI) (stay)
    - parallel+multithreaded 20+30
    - ML (perhaps add example)
- Julia
    - [Schedule](https://github.com/UPPMAX/R-matlab-julia-HPC/blob/main/docs-mk/julia/schedule.md)
    - batch 50
    - parallel+ threaded 45
    - ML not as of today
        - LS could port ML examples
        - 
- Advanced
    - [Schedule](https://github.com/UPPMAX/R-matlab-julia-HPC/blob/main/docs-mk/advanced/schedule.md)
    - RB: I like to have no language-specific sessions.
      I feel that the language-specific days enable the learners
      to have language-agnostic sessions.
      Sure, providing answers for multiple programming languages will be harder for us: I don't mind that
          - Others: As far as possible tabs, but if needed have specific BO rooms in the end
          - Exercises in BO with helpers ready
    - RB: would like to teach 1 hour 'Parallel and multithreaded functions', with (draft) learning outcomes below.
      **Two hours would be fine too.** For all 3 languages at the same time.
        - Learners can schedule and run a job that needs more cores
        - Learners understand when it is possible/impossible and/or useful/useless to run a job with multiple cores


### Suggestion schedule Fri 10

- Richel takes parallel and threading
    - all languages
- All are available and have their language expertise

#### Alt 1

- Reason: MATLAB is quite different in starting the jobs (at least from GUI)
- Reason not: They should know from earlier how to start batch/interactive jobs

- Morning session (focus on slurm)
    - parallelisms
    - ML
- Afternoon session
    - syntax level
        - R
        - MATLAB
        - julia

#### Alt 2 (languages in tabs)

**- This we choose**
- Reason: They should know from earlier how to start batch/interactive jobs
- Problem: where shall we have matlab specific parallel syntax
    - may add a short section last day about matlab specific solutions?

- Morning session
    - parallelisms
        
- Afternoon session
    - ML/gpu
        - slurm 
        - syntax


#### Alt 3

- Morning session
    - R 
        - slurm 
        - syntax
        - ML
    - MATLAB

- Afternoon session
    - julia
        
        
- BC makes schedule

### MkDocs with material-RTD

- RB: [I failed to set up MkDocs with a `material` theme with ReadTheDocs on top of it](https://github.com/UPPMAX/R-matlab-julia-HPC/issues/220#issuecomment-3238888858). I hope someone else can do it or help me do so
- BC takes and confer with Birgitte!


### ToDos

- BC
    - makes friday schedule first version
    - tries to make materials-RTD work
    - makes issues
