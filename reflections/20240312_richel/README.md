# Reflection

 * Teaching day: 2023-03-12
 * Topic: Python
 * Written on 2023-03-12

I prepared well for the lessons, as I remembered from the
previous course iteration that my material was not blended
in with the others. This iteration, my material was 100% part of the
course website and I removed the presentation slides from the
previous iteration.

Although I did invest 10 + 2 + 16 + 2 = 30 hours, 
with little sleep, the day of teaching went fine.

The most obvious problem during teaching 
was that Zoom did not allow me to speak
or show video, in the main room, 
when breakout rooms are active.

I think we dealt with this technical problem 
as good as we reasonably could.

However, due to it, I cannot properly evaluate my own lessons.
I was annoyed with being this blind as a teacher:
how can I know if the learners understood, 
if I cannot see their exercises?
Also, I did not do a half-way-during-the-exercise feedback,
nor a nearly-the-end-of-the-hour feedback.
And I was unable to see if the exercise lengths 
matched the time allocated.

There were some mistakes:

- [Fixed] The exercises on venv failed due to the install of a package
  in the session before. Next time, ruthlessly 
  delete the `/home/richel/.local/lib/python3.11` folder.
  I've added this to the course material
- I could not demo going into the remote desktop website of Rackham.
  Repeat this next time!

I feel that is as much as I have to reflect on.
I think it went quite smoothly when correcting for the
technical error.

## Discussion on other sections

### Pre-requirements

I feel the pre-requirements page, https://uppmax.github.io/R-python-julia-HPC/prereqs.html, is too extensive.
I feel it should link to regular documentation and mostly show
how to determine you fulfilled all pre-requirements.

### Interactive

The session on starting an interactive session feels too fancy twice:
- create an interactive session 
  - with 1 node
  - with more nodes <--- feels beyond the teaching goals
- run 2 Python scripts, 1 of which is unsuitable for an interactive session
  with more nodes.

I think, for 15 minutes, one can only do 1 node and no Python script,
to achieve the teaching goals.

### Impressed by Birgitte

I think it was impressive that Birgitte logs in into both clusters at the start.
I want that too!

### Why ssh `-Y`

Unrelated to the course, Birgitte does so.

### Loading Python

If the session is about loading Python,
maybe seeing module dependencies can removed.

Also, don't care about python3?

Also, don't care about IPython?

### Suggest to Arvid

The Bianca portal is great. Could you do the same for Rackham?
Not every user understands one needs to use 2FA now, and how

### More time for sbatch

There was no time for an exercise.

I would have enjoy to be sure that the learners have been able
to submit a job and see the results.

### More time for GPU

There was no time for an exercise.

### More time for UPPMAX interactive and Jupyter

There was no time for an exercise.

### Parallel programming

I feel that making a script suitable (with `**FIX**` in it) 
for a parallel run is at the 'Synthesis' level of Blooms taxonomy.
I feel that some levels lower, e.g. 'Apply' with a step-by-step
guide would be more suitable.

Today's content and feedback to the lecturers (e.g. materials, exercises, structure): – What did you like best?
exercises

The structure is good.
good material on the web that was easy to follow
The wiki of the course is really good. I will continue using it as a documentation after the course.
materials
A good overview. I think I'll find the Jupyter lab and env extra useful in the future!
The lectures were very clear and the teachers were very good
exercises and structure
The part before lunch was very clear and easy to understand despite the technical issues
The format and structure was good, hands on exercises was also good.
Good instructions, positive supportive and friendly environment, nice course structure, basic exercises.
The topic covered
materials, exercise and structure
Materials and structure were good
Clear exercises and instructions, availability of deepening material
https://uppmax.github.io/R-python-julia-HPC/prereqs.html <- this webpage was great!
I like that the material was very well prepared and with this guidance I understood concepts and managed to do task that I could not do by myself
materials
Very good material, mostly in one location
info mail was +1, same for material

material gathered in one space

Today's content and feedback to the lecturers (e.g. materials, exercises, structure): – Where should we improve?
a bit more time dedicated to Jupyter

The time dedicated for the interactive session/jupyter was not sufficient to try ourselves.


None
Very good, they were motivated and clear.
The last part on Parallel and multi-threaded functions was a bit fast due to time which happens of course but it would be good to learn more on that. 
materials 
The after lunch section was really difficult for me to follow, I feel like the lecturers didn't stop long enough on each topic to explain it properly and I only got a partial understanding
Maybe a better distribution of time between exercises would benefit. Spend less time on the begninnig and give more time to run exmaples on the interactive and parallel parts. Becuase I think this is the part were we need more help.
the 14:00 to 15:00 session was a bit hard to keep up with.
Teaching was quite fast. Sometime hard to follow.
Time per exercise can be optimised. More time for python jupyter and GPU exercises will be good for us.
I personally thought Birgitte was too fast and I could not follow. I liked Richel the most.
Time organization: morning pace was slow compared to the afternoon one. Maybe more time of coding together with the lecturer, especially for the second part of the program (more complex concepts of batch work and interactive work)
If prerequisite is well informed, such as little knowledge on Linus? it would have been better. 
The first part was a good pace for me, but the second part was more complicated and I did not have time to follow and do the exercises. Maybe the second part could be done in another session, because it is the most important part to take use the resources and take advantage of that. However, I got many tools to start my own projects. 

There were some errors/not updated in the exercises in the material. Also can more of the material be on the course pages instead of pointing to documentation at the centers? It makes it clearer when we don't have to go difference places
more time for exercises in afternoon, more time for the batch section, maybe don't ask random people to answer stuff I don't like that (stress - introvert)

more and slower code-alongs
The pace was relatively slow, which was great. as then also those how have very limited knowledge can also keep up the pace. However, in the afternoon it clearly went more faster. Maybe speed up in the morning a bit to have more time practicing actually submitting the jobs? As that was my main motivation for this, I basically skipped the very last lecture about parallelization and instead coded to make submittinch batch jobs work.

Do you have any additional comments? 











Overall a great introductory course to get grasp of the basics in a positive and supportive environment with knowledgeable instructors. 

Can we have something like BYOC and you can show us how to use it to asses time and core used using library multiprocess, please? 
I can not evaluate the performance of each part in a single evaluation form, as I felt it was very different depending on each teacher


Thanks for the course, it was very useful and I feel encouraged to start my project.

More time to exercises. and the zoom problems made it confusing. I know it's not your fault. Maybe don't use breakout rooms so  much , especially when you know there are problems? I have never been in a course where it works well to go back and forth between breakout rooms. Just use them as backup if anyone need to get private help. 
i really need more time for exercises
Thanks for your lecture and your time.
A bit too uneven speed with too low in the morning and too high in the afternoon or at least too little time in the afternoon to go through everything
Some students had problems loggin in to the needed systems. I also just noted that there was this log-in session in Monday when you mentioned it on tuesday. Maybe advertise that in the very beginning of the information email so that it does not go unnoticed. I had no problems loggin etc, but those who had would have benefited participating on Monday
