<h2 id="reflection-1">Reflection 1<a class="headerlink" href="#reflection-1" title="Anchor link to this section for reference">&para;</a></h2>
<p>I prepared well for the lessons, as I remembered from the
previous course iteration that my material was not blended
in with the others. This iteration, my material was 100% part of the
course website and I removed the presentation slides from the
previous iteration.</p>
<p>Although I did invest 10 + 2 + 16 + 2 = 30 hours,
with little sleep, the day of teaching went fine.</p>
<p>The most obvious problem during teaching
was that Zoom did not allow me to speak
or show video, in the main room,
when breakout rooms are active.</p>
<p>I think we dealt with this technical problem
as good as we reasonably could.</p>
<p>However, due to it, I cannot properly evaluate my own lessons.
I was annoyed with being this blind as a teacher:
how can I know if the learners understood,
if I cannot see their exercises?
Also, I did not do a half-way-during-the-exercise feedback,
nor a nearly-the-end-of-the-hour feedback.
And I was unable to see if the exercise lengths
matched the time allocated.</p>
<p>There were some mistakes:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Fixed] The exercises on venv failed due to the install of a package
  in the session before. Next time, ruthlessly
  delete the <code>/home/richel/.local/lib/python3.11</code> folder.
  I&rsquo;ve added this to the course material</li>
<li>I could not demo going into the remote desktop website of Rackham.
  Repeat this next time!</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel that is as much as I have to reflect on.
I think it went quite smoothly when correcting for the
technical error.</p>

<h3 id="pre-requirements">Pre-requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#pre-requirements" title="Anchor link to this section for reference">&para;</a></h3>
<p>I feel the pre-requirements page, <code>[URL]</code>,
is too extensive.
I feel it should link to regular documentation and mostly show
how to determine you fulfilled all pre-requirements.</p>
<h3 id="interactive">Interactive<a class="headerlink" href="#interactive" title="Anchor link to this section for reference">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The session on starting an interactive session feels too fancy twice:</p>
<ul>
<li>create an interactive session<ul>
<li>with 1 node</li>
<li>with more nodes &lt;&mdash; feels beyond the teaching goals</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>run 2 Python scripts, 1 of which is unsuitable for an interactive session
  with more nodes.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think, for 15 minutes, one can only do 1 node and no Python script,
to achieve the teaching goals.</p>

<p>I think it was impressive that Birgitte logs in into both clusters at the start.
I want that too!</p>

<h3 id="loading-python">Loading Python<a class="headerlink" href="#loading-python" title="Anchor link to this section for reference">&para;</a></h3>
<p>If the session is about loading Python,
maybe seeing module dependencies can removed.</p>
<p>Also, don&rsquo;t care about python3?</p>
<p>Also, don&rsquo;t care about IPython?</p>

<p>The Bianca portal is great. Could you do the same for Rackham?

<p>There was no time for an exercise.</p>

<p>I feel that making a script suitable (with <code>**FIX**</code> in it)
for a parallel run is at the &lsquo;Synthesis&rsquo; level of Blooms taxonomy.
I feel that some levels lower, e.g. &lsquo;Apply&rsquo; with a step-by-step
guide would be more suitable.</p>

<p>The learners again like the structure of the course and the course material.</p>
<p>Maybe they do like the
my teaching (&lsquo;The part before lunch&rsquo;)
and my exercises even
better (&lsquo;basic exercises&rsquo;, &lsquo;hands on exercises&rsquo;).</p>
<p>I am happy one learner mentioned &lsquo;positive supportive and friendly environment&rsquo;!</p>

<ul>
<li>a bit more time dedicated to Jupyter</li>
<li>The time dedicated for the interactive session/jupyter was not sufficient
  to try ourselves.</li>
<li>The last part on Parallel and multi-threaded functions was a bit fast
  due to time which happens of course
  but it would be good to learn more on that.</li>
<li>materials</li>
<li>The after lunch section was really difficult for me to follow,
  I feel like the lecturers didn&rsquo;t stop long enough on each topic to explain
  it properly and I only got a partial understanding</li>
<li>Maybe a better distribution of time between exercises would benefit.
  Spend less time on the beginning and give more time to run examples
  on the interactive and parallel parts.
  Because I think this is the part were we need more help.</li>
<li>the 14:00 to 15:00 session was a bit hard to keep up with.</li>
<li>Time per exercise can be optimised. More time for python jupyter and
  GPU exercises will be good for us.</li>
<li>Time organization: morning pace was slow compared to the afternoon one.
  Maybe more time of coding together with the lecturer,
  especially for the second part of the program (more complex concepts of
  batch work and interactive work)</li>
<li>The first part was a good pace for me, but the second part was more
  complicated and I did not have time to follow and do the exercises.
  Maybe the second part could be done in another session,
  because it is the most important part to take use the resources
  and take advantage of that.
  However, I got many tools to start my own projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>&lsquo;The first part&rsquo; was partially my part :-)</p>
<ul>
<li>more time for exercises in afternoon, more time for the batch section,
  maybe don&rsquo;t ask random people to answer stuff I don&rsquo;t like
  that (stress - introvert)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="teaching">Teaching<a class="headerlink" href="#teaching" title="Anchor link to this section for reference">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Teaching was quite fast. Sometime hard to follow.</li>
<li>I personally thought Birgitte was too fast and I could not follow.
  I liked Richel the most.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hey, that is a fun compliment! Thanks!</p>
<ul>
<li>more time for exercises in afternoon, more time for the batch section,
  maybe don&rsquo;t ask random people to answer stuff I don&rsquo;t like that
  (stress - introvert)</li>
</ul>
<p>I will keep asking random people, because a teacher needs to monitor the
progress of all learners. However, at that day, I did not think
it was necessary to share why I ask random learners and that it is
recommended by the literature. I would correct this two days later,
let&rsquo;s see if that made it into the feedback.</p>
<ul>
<li>more and slower code-alongs</li>
<li>The pace was relatively slow, which was great. as then also those how have
  very limited knowledge can also keep up the pace.
  However, in the afternoon it clearly went more faster.
  Maybe speed up in the morning a bit to have more time practicing actually
  submitting the jobs? As that was my main motivation for this,
  I basically skipped the very last lecture about parallelization and
  instead coded to make submitting batch jobs work.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="materials">Materials<a class="headerlink" href="#materials" title="Anchor link to this section for reference">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>There were some errors/not updated in the exercises in the material.
  Also can more of the material be on the course pages instead of
  pointing to documentation at the centers?
  It makes it clearer when we don&rsquo;t have to go difference places</li>
</ul>
<p>I understand this feedback, yet I do think it is a bad idea: a learner
should get accustomed to the documentation of his/her HPC center.</p>
<h3 id="other">Other<a class="headerlink" href="#other" title="Anchor link to this section for reference">&para;</a></h3>

<p>Most of the negative feedback was about the high pace
in general, yet mostly in the afternoon.
I feel I was not the reason for that feedback.</p>
<p>I did get negative feedback on:</p>
<ul>
<li>course material in one place</li>
<li>ask random people</li>
</ul>
<p>Although I agree with the feedback, I will not change this,
as there are good reasons to do so.</p>

<p>I think this is a nonsense questions: either we do
exercises (i.e. active teaching) or we do demonstrations
(i.e. passive teaching).
Only from this question, one would have idea what was too few off:
only the written texts earlier indicates that there should be more exercises.</p>

<li>A bit too uneven speed with too low in the morning and too high in the
  afternoon or at least too little time in the afternoon
  to go through everything</li>
</ul>
<p>Agreed, I think learning-centered teaching would solve this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some students had problems logging in to the needed systems.
  I also just noted that there was this log-in session in Monday
  when you mentioned it on tuesday.
  Maybe advertise that in the very beginning of the information email
  so that it does not go unnoticed.
  I had no problems logging etc, but those who had would have
  benefited participating on Monday</li>

<p>Agreed, we could be more ruthless in letting our learners in, e.g. by putting
the link to the Zoom on Rackham and Kebnekaise.</p>

<li>More time to exercises. and the zoom problems made it confusing.
  I know it&rsquo;s not your fault. Maybe don&rsquo;t use breakout rooms so  much,
  especially when you know there are problems? I have never been in a course
  where it works well to go back and forth between breakout rooms.
  Just use them as backup if anyone need to get private help.</li>
</ul>
<p>I agree that the technical problems are annoying. The Zoom room use,
i.e. of having a silent room, I now think it is a bad idea.
Instead, doing Pair-Share-Pound in little groups would make it work.</p>

<ul>
<li>What should we keep doing?</li>

<li>What should we improve?</li>
