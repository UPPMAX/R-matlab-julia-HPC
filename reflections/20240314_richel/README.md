# Reflection

 * Teaching day: 2023-03-14
 * Topic: R
 * Written on 2023-03-14

I only taught the first hour.

I talk before teaching, it feels nicer.

At the start of the lecture, I shared that I will pick random people
and why. Adding the 'why' hopefully helps learners understand
why I should do that. I feel discussing teaching literature should
not be done during a lesson, yet, however, it does show that I
read (part of) the student evaluation.

At the 'Prior Knowledge' part, I asked randomly and polled answers using
Zoom 'Reactions'. When discussing modules, it made me see that not everyone
understood what modules are. This allowed me to backtrack and discuss
what modules are.

I feel I talked too long and I went to slow.
Instead of going through the text, only give an
overview and enough info to do the exercises.
Exercises should start with 'read ...'.

- [ ] TODO: talk less, more time for exercises

Could not do 'Feedback' due to technical problem.

Technical problem was solved after updating Zoom.

There was a copy-paste mistakes in the R versions used,
as there is a difference between the one on HPC2N and the one on UPPMAX.
During the exercises, the learners found out, 
contacted me and I fixed it immediately.

There were mistakes in the HPC2N answers.
During the exercises, the HPC2N users found out 
that it did not work. This is probably because the course
switched to using R 4.1.2 and it was forgotten to update
the version of the prerequisite modules.
During a one-on-one with a learner in a breakout room,
we used `module help R/4.1.2`, loaded the prerequisites
of the right version and observed it worked.
I immediately updated the documentation.

Although there were mistakes found in my exercises,
I gave the learners the most time on doing exercises,
monitored their progress during this and
interacted with them. Or: mistakes were found in my
exercises, because the exercises were actually done 
with a level of interaction that allows the learners
to actually share the mistakes.

I wonder how many learners:

- have started R (I could not ask, due to technical problem)
- have run an R script (I could not ask, due to technical problem)

I lead the evaluation. I took the learners to a Breakout room,
told them why this is important, how to answer and to come
back to the main room to say bye or ask questions.

## Things beyond my teaching

There was a mismatch between the schedule we as teachers had 
in a shared HackMD document and the one on the course website.
Already in a meeting, I suggested to remove the shared HackMD document
one, to prevent the possibility of a mismatch, but there was resistance there.
The teachers improvised.

I have a hard time to summarize the learning objectives of other lessons:
there is too much stuff that is 'nice to have' in it;
it feels more like if randomly content gets added or deleted.
What is the decision rule to decide what should be in and what should not
for those lessons? 

Examples of content I remove, as it would not fit my teaching goals:

- describing an R package in details: this is not an R course
- when learning how to run an R script, running it on multiple nodes: 
  do that in the session on parallel programs
- on R virtual environments: use a virtual environment, not describe
  what it is in detail
- in the parallel programs, letting learners fix code for parallizing
  code: this is not a course on parallel programming. Instead,
  let them run code that can do calculations in parallel, on the CPU/GPU

I feel that when someone is teaching, he/she should prioritize interacting
with the learners over answering questions in a shared document. 
I feel the other team members should answer the questions in a shared
document, so that the main teacher can focus on interacting with the learners.

For the other session, I wonder how many learners:

- have created a virtual environment
- have run code that uses a GPU
- have run code that uses machine learning
- have installed a package from CRAN
- have installed a package from GitHub
- have logged in with the remote desktop website
- have logged in with a local ThinLinc client
- have started RStudio
