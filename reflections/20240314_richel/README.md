# Reflection

I only taught the first hour.

I talk before teaching, it feels nicer.

I feel I talked too long and I went to slow.
Instead of going through the text, only give an
overview and enough info to do the exercises.
Exercises should start with 'read ...'.

- [ ] TODO: talk less, more time for exercises

Could not do 'feedback' due to technical problem.

Technical problem was solved after updating Zoom.

There was a copy-paste mistakes in the R versions used,
as there is a difference between the one on HPC2N and the one on UPPMAX.
During the exercises, the learners found out, 
contacted me and I fixed it immediately.

There were mistakes in the HPC2N answers.
During the exercises, the HPC2N users found out 
that it did not work. This is probably because the course
switched to using R 4.1.2 and it was forgotten to update
the version of the prerequisite modules.
During a one-on-one with a learner in a breakout room,
we used `module help R/4.1.2`, loaded the prerequisites
of the right version and observed it worked.
I immediately updated the documentation.
