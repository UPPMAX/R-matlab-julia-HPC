I only taught the first hour.

I talk before teaching, it feels nicer.

I feel I talked too long and I went to slow.
Instead of going through the text, only give an
overview and enough info to do the exercises.
Exercises should start with 'read ...'.

Could not do 'feedback' due to technical problem.

Technical problem was solved after updating Zoom.
