# Reflection

 * Teaching day: 2024-10-22
 * Topic: Python
 * Written on 2024-1?-??

Before teaching, one thing that I think can be improved,
is our decision making. As an example, there was a change
decided upon regarding the schedule on 2024-10-18 (course is at 2024-10-21),
after we've already voted to accept the schedule before that.
I was unconvinced that we should change the schedule, but I was a minority,
so I accepted the democratic decision to change the schedule again.
I hope next time we can decide on the schedule earlier and freeze it,
say, at least one week before the course.

Before teaching, one thing that I think can be improved too,
is to use Markdown instead of RestructuredText:
using RestructuredText makes everything I do harder.
Taking a look at
[the StackOverflow developer survey of 2023](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023),
Markdown is mentioned and admired, where RestructuredText is completely absent.
I'd enjoy converting all these pages to Markdown and then use good MkDocs
instead :+1:
