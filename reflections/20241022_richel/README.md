# Reflection

 * Teaching day: 2024-10-22
 * Topic: Python

Before teaching, one thing that I think can be improved,
is our decision making. As an example, there was a change
decided upon regarding the schedule on 2024-10-18 (course is at 2024-10-21),
after we've already voted to accept the schedule before that.
I was unconvinced that we should change the schedule, but I was a minority,
so I accepted the democratic decision to change the schedule again.
I hope next time we can decide on the schedule earlier and freeze it,
say, at least one week before the course.

Before teaching, one thing that I think can be improved too,
is to use Markdown instead of RestructuredText:
using RestructuredText makes everything I do harder.
Taking a look at
[the StackOverflow developer survey of 2023](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023),
Markdown is mentioned and admired, where RestructuredText is completely absent.
I'd enjoy converting all these pages to Markdown and then use good MkDocs
instead :+1:

Before teaching, I was wondering about how we make sure the learners log
in. Currently, there is an onboarding session and a daily 9:00-9:50
optional login session. I feel we treat the learners better than reasonable:
when it is in the course prerequisites that its is required to be able to
log in and we have an onboarding, we should be able to assume that learners
can log in. This means that when a learner joins without being able
to log in, it is acceptable to only help the learner when there is time
(which is close to never). One way to meet in the middle, is to have daily
log in sessions at 8:00, so this will not affect the teaching.

Before teaching, I saw the evaluation. Beyond the 'rate your confidence'
questions I prepared, more questions were added. Maybe because HPC2N
requires that.

9:18: Around 12 learners have visited. After telling each of them
that they can go if (1) they have logged in and (2) can use a text editor,
around 3 hang around with their cameras off. I assume they are
waiting for the lesson to start.
