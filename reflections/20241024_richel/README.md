## Login session

4 learners showed up for this optional session:

- 3x could already login
- 1x a LUNARC user that needed help, I put him in a Zoom room with the LUNARC
  teacher

## Session: 10:00-10:45: intro and syllabus and load and run R

There were 5 learners. I did the regular teaching cycles, with a Prior
at the start. There were 3 that -per my request- turned on their camera,
with 2 left after the announcement that the session will be recorded.
At 10:21 I started the exercise and at 10:40 I discussed it.
At 10:40, upon asking for a yes/no reaction, 5 out of 5 learners signalled
they had been able to do the exercise. I rounded of the session
by going over the key points again.

As already was in the lesson plan, I don't like this session.
I do think many people think this stock-standard way of teaching
is fine, but I'd enjoy better to have the learners learn from
each center's documentation, as this will be more helpful.
Instead, now, the session is more a copy-paste exercise, except
for the Prior and Repeat. I can imagine learners like it (we know
learners like passive teaching), but they could actually have learned
more.

- [ ] In the next course iteration: use more active learning methods in this
  session

## Session 14:30-15:15: interactive and RStudio

It was delayed 15 minutes, which was no problem.
Prior took 15 minutes, in which I recapped earlier sessions too.
I gave the learners 15 minutes for the exercise.
All 4 learners were able to complete the procedure.

During the 15 minutes, there was 1 learner that shared her
screen with a question beyond the content of this session.
1 learner needed to install a local ThinLinc client and this
did not work. That learner did see how it looked like
and stated she is confident she could do it via the website.

As the learning objectives were achieved, I ended the session earlier
(there were no more questions).
I do think the session's length is correct, in the case there would
be some slower learners.

I told the 4 learners when the next session would start,
which was 15 minutes later on the schedule, as
I expected other sessions to do take the scheduled amount of time.
However, it turned out that the next session would like to start
earlier. I took the blame and hoped for the best.
What I did not know is that it would be only the UPPMAX learners left,
so we could have easily started 15 minutes earlier.

## Session 16:00-16:15: summary and evaluation

I've not shown the summary, although it follows the
evaluation questions, as I feel it increases the evaluation
results, as the confidences will be higher, due to the refresher.
The full procedure took 3 minutes. It took 5 minutes
for the 5 learners to fill in the evaluation forms.
All learners said bye, except for 1.
That 1 learner had a question, which was answered.

I discussed this story with a colleague afterwards.
He will try out a combination of showing
summary yes/no, answers in summary yes/no
and report to me.
