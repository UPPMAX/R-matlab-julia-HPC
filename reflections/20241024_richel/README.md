## Login session

4 learners showed up for this optional session:

- 3x could already login
- 1x a LUNARC user that needed help, I put him in a Zoom room with the LUNARC
  teacher

## Session: 10:00-10:45: intro and syllabus and load and run R

There were 5 learners. I did the regular teaching cycles, with a Prior
at the start. There were 3 that -per my request- turned on their camera,
with 2 left after the announcement that the session will be recorded.
At 10:21 I started the exercise and at 10:40 I discussed it.
At 10:40, upon asking for a yes/no reaction, 5 out of 5 learners signalled
they had been able to do the exercise. I rounded of the session
by going over the key points again.

As already was in the lesson plan, I don't like this session.
I do think many people think this stock-standard way of teaching
is fine, but I'd enjoy better to have the learners learn from
each center's documentation, as this will be more helpful.
Instead, now, the session is more a copy-paste exercise, except
for the Prior and Repeat. I can imagine learners like it (we know
learners like passive teaching), but they could actually have learned
more.

- [ ] In the next course iteration: use more active learning methods in this
  session
