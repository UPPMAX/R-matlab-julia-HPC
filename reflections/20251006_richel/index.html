<ul>
<li>Author: Richel</li>
<li>Date: 2025-10-06</li>
<li>Day: R</li>
</ul>
<p>I was ill in the morning. I was ill already for a week and hence
was more absent from all team discussions.</p>
<h2 id="teaching-900-first-login">Teaching 9:00 First login<a class="headerlink" href="#teaching-900-first-login" title="Anchor link to this section for reference">&para;</a></h2>
<p>There were 5 visitors. Me and the team were able to help all of them.
I&rsquo;ve helped 1 learner and it was a good experience: she was a complete
beginner and at the end of my, around 15 minutes, help, she
was super ready.</p>
<h2 id="teaching-1000-load-modules-and-run">Teaching 10:00 Load modules and run<a class="headerlink" href="#teaching-1000-load-modules-and-run" title="Anchor link to this section for reference">&para;</a></h2>
<p>There were 6 learners. Most time was spent with the 1 learner
that did not attend the login session.</p>
<p>When ill, my talking is slower. A good thing. However, due to the constant
pain, I do not enjoy my teaching sessions as usual.</p>
<p>I did meet all students properly. At 10:47 2 (out of 6) were done: I sent them
on an earlier break. </p>
<h2 id="teaching-1400-rstudio">Teaching 14:00 RStudio<a class="headerlink" href="#teaching-1400-rstudio" title="Anchor link to this section for reference">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Me and a colleague split up the learners:
the colleague offered to help, as it was unsure
how well I was (as I was less response in chat,
due to -indeed- illness). I think it is nice
to get unexpected help and I think it is
a good idea that she had a 1-on-1 with &lsquo;her&rsquo;
COSMOS users. So, we split up, after announcing
this in the main room.</p>
<p>I was very happy to see my learners again. We
were with 3, 1 that used Sigma, and 2 that used
Dardel. I started with the Sigma user,
as (1) she has no documentation, 
and (2) Dardel has Open OnDemand, which is easier.
I did so after discussing this with the whole group.</p>
<p>When the Sigma user was in the system (for the
first time), I told her to try a bit for herself,
so I could talk to the Dardel users. We agreed.</p>
<p>I disturbed the Dardel users. They were already done.
I told them that in 5 minutes I will give a bit
more in-depth demo about RStudio, after helping
the Sigma user (which I estimated to cost that
long). The Dardel users agreed.</p>
<p>The Sigma user was in quickly, so we started talking
as a class again. I did my demo on RStudio,
until it was time again to back to the main room.</p>
<p>I remember from earlier reflections that
I should not be too informal, and I think
I succeeded reasonably (but not perfectly)
well: it felt too nice to have them back :-)</p>
<h2 id="1500-summary-and-evaluation">15:00 Summary and Evaluation<a class="headerlink" href="#1500-summary-and-evaluation" title="Anchor link to this section for reference">&para;</a></h2>
<p>I went through the summary. What was missing
was a list of other course.</p>
<ul>
<li>[x] Add link to SCoRe list of courses</li>
</ul>
<p>The evaluation was clean: I told them why I
put them in breakout rooms. One out of six
learners came back to ask his questions, which
I discussed in a breakout room.</p>
<h2 id="predictions">Predictions<a class="headerlink" href="#predictions" title="Anchor link to this section for reference">&para;</a></h2>
<p>My sessions went very well:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the &lsquo;Load modules and run&rsquo; session,
  I have seen all run the R interpreter</li>
<li>In the RStudio session,
  I have seen all run RStudio</li>

<p>The only useful item is &lsquo;Do you have any additional comments?&rsquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>I liked the online material about how to prepare and get everything set up,
  which has been my main issue so far.
  Unfortunately I could not initially run R via the terminal/ssh,
  so I couldn&rsquo;t do the practicals on batch,
  but I am sure I can figure it out myself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Too bad. Nothing to be done about that I guess &hellip;?</p>
<ul>
<li>no</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure :-)</p>
<ul>
<li>no</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure :-)</p>
<ul>
<li>awesome material and good that you record but could you record during
  the lectures all of you so we get the exact thing that is taught?
  i&rsquo;m also not fond of having to have the camera on
  which i felt there was pressure to do
  so i watched most after the course instead</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an interesting comment: on the one hand this person
mentions to not like the camera. On the other hand,
the learning outcomes for my early sessions for that person are
highest:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Learning outcome</th>
<th>Camera</th>
<th>Confidence</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I can find the module to be able to run R</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>I can absolutely do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I can load the module to be able to run R</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>I can absolutely do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I can run the R interpreter</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>I can absolutely do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I can run the R command to get the list of installed R packages</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>I can absolutely do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I can run an R script from the command-line</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>I have good confidence I can do this</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I can find out if an R package is already installed</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>I have good confidence I can do this</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I can load the pre-installed R packages</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>I have good confidence I can do this</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I can install an R package from CRAN</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>I have good confidence I can do this</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I can submit a job to the scheduler to run an R script with regular code</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>I have some confidence I can do this</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I can submit a job to the scheduler to run an R script that uses parallel code</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>I have some confidence I can do this</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I can start an interactive session</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>I have low confidence I can do this</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So in this case, higher learning outcomes were achieved in the sessions
with a camera, including by the person that did not like using a camera.</p>
<p>About having videos to the material,
I find that live recordings have
&lsquo;No performance advantage was found for viewing recordings despite students&rsquo;
positive perception of their utility.&rsquo;

Internet Journal of Allied Health Sciences and Practice 22.2 (2024): 9., 
<a href="https://nsuworks.nova.edu/ijahsp/vol22/iss2/9/">Link to paper</a>].
However, that paper does find positive effects for learners that, unlike
here, use it <strong>after</strong> attending a session.</p>
<h2 id="the-rstudio-sessions">The RStudio sessions<a class="headerlink" href="#the-rstudio-sessions" title="Anchor link to this section for reference">&para;</a></h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve compared the simultaneous sessions of this course&rsquo;s
iteration with the previous course iteration where I was the only teacher:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>learning_outcome</th>
<th>teacher</th>
<th>average_confidence</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I can start an interactive session with multiple cores</td>
<td>RB+RP</td>
<td>1.4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I can verify I am on the login node yes/no</td>
<td>RB+RP</td>
<td>1.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I can start RStudio</td>
<td>RB+RP</td>
<td>2.7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I can verify I am on the login node yes/no</td>
<td>RB</td>
<td>3.1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I can start an interactive session with multiple cores</td>
<td>RB</td>
<td>3.1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I can start RStudio</td>
<td>RB</td>
<td>3.4</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It seems same enough. The biggest differences are from things that one does not
need when using Open OnDemand.</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Remove learning outcome 
  &lsquo;I can start an interactive session with multiple cores&rsquo;</li>
<li>[ ] Remove learning outcome 
  &lsquo;I can verify I am on the login node yes/no&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking a look at the confidences per question for RStudio:</p>
<p><img alt="Confidences per question for RStudio" src="20251006_confidences_per_question_rstudio.png" /></p>
<p>Could it be that we both scored &lsquo;I can absolutely do this!&rsquo;
and that deviations from this are explained by
people not following the session?</p>
<p>Here is when learners rated the RStudio session:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Starting time</th>
<th>Confidence for &lsquo;I can start RStudio&rsquo;</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>10/6/2025 14:45</td>
<td>I can absolutely do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10/6/2025 14:54</td>
<td>I have no confidence I can do this</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10/6/2025 14:53</td>
<td>I can absolutely do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10/6/2025 14:53</td>
<td>I can absolutely do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10/6/2025 14:53</td>
<td>I can absolutely do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10/17/2025 13:09</td>
<td>I have no confidence I can do this</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I think the last person may not have followed this session at all.
It would make
sense: I&rsquo;ve had 2 and Rebecca had -according to my notes- 2 or 3.
I think it is likely enough that 4x &lsquo;I can absolutely do this!&rsquo;
comes from the 4 learners attending our session
and the 1x &lsquo;I have no confidence I can do this&rsquo;
comes from the COSMOS SENS person.
I conclude that me and Rebecca did a perfect job!</p>
<p>This brings us to another problem: the learner that was absent
filled in a &lsquo;I have no confidence I can do this&rsquo;
over skipping the question. As far as I remember, it was impossible
to skip questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Suggest to make confidences optional (i.e. one can get away
  to not fill in a confidence) to remove this skew</li>
</ul>
