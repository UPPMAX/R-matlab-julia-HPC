How to use multi-node setup for training models on CPU and GPU. R provides many packages that are specifically designed for machine learning. R is also known for its statistical capabilities for analysis and interpretation of data. This all makes it easier to develop and deploy models, also without having to write a lot of code yourself. The R community has contributed many powerful packages, both for machine learning and data science. Some of the popular packages are: Package What it does Dplyr Enables dataframe manipulation in an intuitive, user-friendly way. One of the core packages of the popular tidyverse set of packages Tidyr Provides a bunch of tools to help tidy up your messy datasets. tidyr is a member of the core tidyverse Caret A set of functions that attempt to streamline the process for creating predictive models. Short for Classification And REgression Training MLR R has no standardized interface for its ML algorithms. MLR provides this infrastructure. The framework provides supervised methods like classification, regression and survival analysis along with their corresponding evaluation and optimization methods, as well as unsupervised methods like clustering. You can extend it yourself or deviate from the implemented convenience methods and construct your own complex experiments or algorithms ggplot2 A system for declaratively creating graphics. Part of tidyverse randomForest implements Breiman\u2019s random forest algorithm mlbench A collection of artificial and real-world machine learning benchmark problem stringr Provides a cohesive set of functions designed to make working with strings as easy as possible tidyverse A set of packages that work in harmony because they share common data representations and API design. Some of the popular packages in this set is: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, stringr, and many more and others.

Demo Prerequisites Choose an R version > 4.1 and a CUDA module. NSC PDC C3SE HPC2N LUNARC UPPMAX There is no compatible CUDA and R, so the best option seems to be to be to install your own R with conda. It will take quite some space, so do it in your project storage: $ ml buildenv-gcccuda/11.6.2-gcc9-hpc1 $ ml buildtool-easybuild/4.9.4-hpc71cbb0050 $ ml Miniforge/24.7.1-2-hpc1 $ cd /proj/courses-fall-2025/users/<username> $ conda create -n myenv $ conda activate myenv $ mamba create -n R -c conda-forge r-base -y $ mamba activate R $ mamba install -c conda-forge r-essentials $ R --quiet --no-save --no-restore -e \"install.packages('tictoc', repos='http://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/CRAN/')\" The example with xgboost will unfortunately not work on Dardel, as it works only for CUDA-capable GPUs. $ ml R/4.2.1-foss-2022a $ ml CUDA/12.9.1 ml GCC/13.2.0 R/4.4.1 CUDA/12.1.1 ml OpenMPI/4.1.6 R-bundle-CRAN/2024.06 module load GCC/12.3.0 OpenMPI/4.1.5 R/4.4.1 module load R-bundle-CRAN/2023.12-R-4.4.1 CUDA ml R/4.4.2-gfbf-2024a R-bundle-CRAN/2024.11-foss-2024a R-bundle-Bioconductor/3.20-foss-2024a-R-4.4.2 Get a release xgboost version with GPU support and place it in the package directory for your R version - if you are using the project storage, change to that - If you have not created a package directory for the version of R you will use here, then follow the steps under setup cd /home/u/username/R-packages-4.4.1 wget https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/releases/download/v1.5.0rc1/xgboost_r_gpu_linux.tar.gz Note If on NSC, activate your newly created conda environment, if you are not already there. Create a suitable directory for installing (probably for R 4.5.1) and add to .bashrc if you have not already: mkdir -p /proj/courses-fall-2025/users/<username>/R-packages-4.5.1 echo R_LIBS_USER = \"<path-to-your-space-on-proj-storage>/R-packages-%V\" > ~/.Renviron Then, install the package R CMD INSTALL ./xgboost_r_gpu_linux.tar.gz Download a data set like the HIGGS data set for detecting Higgs particles that is large enough to benefit from GPU acceleration (it can take several minutes to download and uncompress).

How to use multi-node setup for training models on CPU and GPU. R provides many packages that are specifically designed for machine learning. R is also known for its statistical capabilities for analysis and interpretation of data. This all makes it easier to develop and deploy models, also without having to write a lot of code yourself. The R community has contributed many powerful packages, both for machine learning and data science. Some of the popular packages are: Package What it does Dplyr Enables dataframe manipulation in an intuitive, user-friendly way. One of the core packages of the popular tidyverse set of packages Tidyr Provides a bunch of tools to help tidy up your messy datasets. tidyr is a member of the core tidyverse Caret A set of functions that attempt to streamline the process for creating predictive models. Short for Classification And REgression Training MLR R has no standardized interface for its ML algorithms. MLR provides this infrastructure. The framework provides supervised methods like classification, regression and survival analysis along with their corresponding evaluation and optimization methods, as well as unsupervised methods like clustering.

How to enable GPUs? How to deploy GPUs at HPC2N, UPPMAX, LUNARC, NSC, PDC and C3SE? Objectives Get an intro to common schemes for GPU code acceleration Learn about the GPU nodes at HPC2N, UPPMAX, LUNARC, NSC, PDC, and C3SE Learn how to make a batch script asking for GPU nodes at HPC2N, UPPMAX, LUNARC, NSC, PDC, and C3SE Introduction \u00b6 In order to understand the capabilities of a GPU, it is instructive to compare a pure CPU architecture with a GPU based architecture. Here, there is a schematics of the former: Pure CPU architecture (single node). In the present case there are 256 cores, each with its own cache memory (LX). There is a shared memory (~378 GB/NUMA node) for all these cores. This is an AMD Zen4 node. The base frequency is 2.25 GHz, but it can boost up to 3.1 GHz. As for the GPU architecture, a GPU card of type Ada Lovelace (like the L40s) looks like this: Note: The AD102 GPU also includes 288 FP64 Cores (2 per SM) which are not depicted in the above diagram. The FP64 TFLOP rate is 1/64th the TFLOP rate of FP32 operations. The small number of FP64 Cores are included to ensure any programs with FP64 code operate correctly, including FP64 Tensor Core code. This is a single GPU engine of a L40s card. There are 12 Graphics Processing Clusters (GPCs), 72 Texture Processing Clusters (TPCs), 144 Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs), and a 384-bit memory interface with 12 32-bit memory controllers). On the diagram, each green dot represents a CUDA core (single precision), while the yellow are RT cores and blue Tensor cores. The cores are arranged in the slots called SMs in the figure. Cores in the same SM share some local and fast cache memory. GPCs The GPC is the dominant high-level hardware block. Each GPC includes a dedicated Raster Engine, two Raster Operations (ROPs) partitions, with each partition containing eight individual ROP units, and six TPCs. Each TPC includes one PolyMorph Engine and two SMs. Each SM contain 128 CUDA Cores, one Ada Third-Generation RT Core, four Ada Fourth-Generation Tensor Cores, four Texture Units, a 256 KB Register File, and 128 KB of L1/Shared Memory, which can be configured for different memory sizes depending on the needs of the graphics or compute workload. In a typical cluster, some GPUs are attached to a single node resulting in a CPU-GPU hybrid architecture. The CPU component is called the host and the GPU part the device. One possible layout Kebnekaise, AMD Zen4 node with L40s GPU Schematics of a hybrid CPU-GPU architecture. A GPU L40s card is attached to a NUMA island which in turn contains 24 cores (AMD Zen4 CPU node with 48 cores total). The NUMA island and the GPUs are connected through a PCI-E interconnect which makes the data transfer between both components rather slow. We can characterize the CPU and GPU performance with two quantities: the latency and the throughput . Latency refers to the time spent in a sole computation. Throughput denotes the number of computations that can be performed in parallel. Then, we can say that a CPU has low latency (able to do fast computations) but low throughput (only a few computations simultaneously). In the case of GPUs, the latency is high and the throughput is also high. We can visualize the behavior of the CPUs and GPUs with cars as in the figure below. A CPU would be compact road where only a few racing cars can drive whereas a GPU would be a broader road where plenty of slow cars can drive. Cars and roads analogy for the CPU and GPU behavior. The compact road is analogous to the CPU (low latency, low throughput) and the broader road is analogous to the GPU (high latency, high throughput). Not every program is suitable for GPU acceleration. GPUs process simple functions rapidly, and are best suited for repetitive and highly-parallel computing tasks. GPUs were originally designed to render high-resolution images and video concurrently and fast, but since they can perform parallel operations on multiple sets of data, they are also often used for other, non-graphical tasks. Common uses are machine learning and scientific computation were the GPUs can take advantage of massive parallelism. Many R packages are not CUDA aware, but some have been written specifically with GPUs in mind. Many Julia packages are not CUDA aware. The CUDA.jl package is the main programming interface for working with Nvidia GPUs. Matlab does have support for computing on GPUs, but you need to write functions that support GPU execution. Many functions in Matlab run automatically on a GPU if you supply a gpuArray data argument. GPU computing in MATLAB requires Parallel Computing Toolbox. Information here: Run MATLAB Functions on a GPU . One of the most common use of GPUs with and Julia is for machine learning or deep learning. GPUs on C3SE, UPPMAX, HPC2N, LUNARC, NSC, and PDC systems \u00b6 There are generally either not GPUs on the login nodes or they cannot be accessed for computations. To use them you need to either launch an interactive job or submit a batch job. C3SE NSC PDC UPPMAX HPC2N LUNARC Alvis is meant for GPU jobs.

In order to access them, add this to your batch script or interactive job: You need to add this to your batch script (or interactive job) in order to use them: #SBATCH -N 1 #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1 #SBATCH -p gpu NOTE: the fact that Dardel has AMD GPUs means that CUDA-enabled packages will not run! You need something like hip. Rackham\u2019s compute nodes do not have GPUs. You need to use Snowy for that. The new cluster Pelle has GPUs. On Pelle, you need to use this batch command: for L40s GPUs (up to 10 GPU cards) #SBATCH -p gpu #SBATCH --gpus:l40s:<number of GPUs> or for H100 GPUs (up to 2 GPU cards) #SBATCH -p gpu #SBATCH --gpus=h100:<number of GPUs> Kebnekaise\u2019s GPU nodes are considered a separate resource, and the regular compute nodes do not have GPUs. Kebnekaise has a great many different types of GPUs: V100 (2 cards/node) A40 (8 cards/node) A6000 (2 cards/node) L40s (2 or 6 cards/node) A100 (2 cards/node) H100 (4 cards/node) MI100 (2 cards/node) To access them, you need to use this to the batch system: #SBATCH --gpus=x where x is the number of GPU cards you want. Above are given how many are on each type, so you can ask for up to that number. In addition, you need to add this to the batch system: #SBATCH -C <type> where type is v100 a40 a6000 l40s a100 h100 mi100 For more information, see HPC2N\u2019s guide to the different parts of the batch system: https://docs.hpc2n.umu.se/documentation/batchsystem/resources/ LUNARC has Nvidia A100 GPUs and Nvidia A40 GPUs, but the latter ones are reserved for interactive graphics work on the on-demand system, and Slurm jobs should not be submitted to them. Thus in order to use the A100 GPUs on Cosmos, add this to your batch script: A100 GPUs on AMD nodes: #SBATCH -p gpua100 #SBATCH --gres=gpu:1 These nodes are configured as exclusive access and will not be shared between users. User projects will be charged for the entire node (48 cores). A job on a node will also have access to all memory on the node. A100 GPUs on Intel nodes: #SBATCH -p gpua100i #SBATCH --gres=gpu:<number> where <number> is 1 or 2 (Two of the nodes have 1 GPU and two have 2 GPUs). Deploying GPUs \u00b6 As mentioned, you need a batch job or an interactive job (could also be through Open OnDemand or from inside MATLAB) to use the GPUs. R \u00b6 Here follows an example of a batch script that allocates GPUs. This is for an R job, but it is done similarly for Julia and Matlab.

Inside MATLAB \u00b6 In order to use GPUs from inside MATLAB, you must add them as additional properties to your profile. This is done the same whether you use MATLAB on the command line or inside the GUI. If you work inside the GUI it is also possible to set these GPU values in the Cluster Profile Manager. Remember, after it is saved to your profile it will use GPUs again next time you submit a job, even if you don\u2019t want GPUs there. To reset this, do: c.AdditionalProperties.GpuCard = '' ; c.AdditionalProperties.GpusPerNode = '' ; This is how you add GPUs to use in batch jobs submitted from inside MATLAB: Important Ask for a GPU and enough time to do what you need.

In the case of AMD GPUs for Julia (PDC and HPC2N), you will need to load a ROCM toolkit module on the cluster and install the AMDGPU package in Julia as in the next sequence of commands. Prerequisites UPPMAX HPC2N LUNARC PDC NSC This can only be done on Snowy or Bianca.

Here, there is a schematics of the former: Pure CPU architecture (single node). In the present case there are 256 cores, each with its own cache memory (LX). There is a shared memory (~378 GB/NUMA node) for all these cores. This is an AMD Zen4 node. The base frequency is 2.25 GHz, but it can boost up to 3.1 GHz. As for the GPU architecture, a GPU card of type Ada Lovelace (like the L40s) looks like this: Note: The AD102 GPU also includes 288 FP64 Cores (2 per SM) which are not depicted in the above diagram. The FP64 TFLOP rate is 1/64th the TFLOP rate of FP32 operations. The small number of FP64 Cores are included to ensure any programs with FP64 code operate correctly, including FP64 Tensor Core code. This is a single GPU engine of a L40s card. There are 12 Graphics Processing Clusters (GPCs), 72 Texture Processing Clusters (TPCs), 144 Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs), and a 384-bit memory interface with 12 32-bit memory controllers). On the diagram, each green dot represents a CUDA core (single precision), while the yellow are RT cores and blue Tensor cores. The cores are arranged in the slots called SMs in the figure. Cores in the same SM share some local and fast cache memory. GPCs The GPC is the dominant high-level hardware block. Each GPC includes a dedicated Raster Engine, two Raster Operations (ROPs) partitions, with each partition containing eight individual ROP units, and six TPCs. Each TPC includes one PolyMorph Engine and two SMs. Each SM contain 128 CUDA Cores, one Ada Third-Generation RT Core, four Ada Fourth-Generation Tensor Cores, four Texture Units, a 256 KB Register File, and 128 KB of L1/Shared Memory, which can be configured for different memory sizes depending on the needs of the graphics or compute workload. In a typical cluster, some GPUs are attached to a single node resulting in a CPU-GPU hybrid architecture. The CPU component is called the host and the GPU part the device. One possible layout Kebnekaise, AMD Zen4 node with L40s GPU Schematics of a hybrid CPU-GPU architecture. A GPU L40s card is attached to a NUMA island which in turn contains 24 cores (AMD Zen4 CPU node with 48 cores total). The NUMA island and the GPUs are connected through a PCI-E interconnect which makes the data transfer between both components rather slow. We can characterize the CPU and GPU performance with two quantities: the latency and the throughput . Latency refers to the time spent in a sole computation. Throughput denotes the number of computations that can be performed in parallel. Then, we can say that a CPU has low latency (able to do fast computations) but low throughput (only a few computations simultaneously). In the case of GPUs, the latency is high and the throughput is also high. We can visualize the behavior of the CPUs and GPUs with cars as in the figure below. A CPU would be compact road where only a few racing cars can drive whereas a GPU would be a broader road where plenty of slow cars can drive. Cars and roads analogy for the CPU and GPU behavior. The compact road is analogous to the CPU (low latency, low throughput) and the broader road is analogous to the GPU (high latency, high throughput). Not every program is suitable for GPU acceleration. GPUs process simple functions rapidly, and are best suited for repetitive and highly-parallel computing tasks. GPUs were originally designed to render high-resolution images and video concurrently and fast, but since they can perform parallel operations on multiple sets of data, they are also often used for other, non-graphical tasks. Common uses are machine learning and scientific computation were the GPUs can take advantage of massive parallelism. Many R packages are not CUDA aware, but some have been written specifically with GPUs in mind. Many Julia packages are not CUDA aware. The CUDA.jl package is the main programming interface for working with Nvidia GPUs. Matlab does have support for computing on GPUs, but you need to write functions that support GPU execution. Many functions in Matlab run automatically on a GPU if you supply a gpuArray data argument. GPU computing in MATLAB requires Parallel Computing Toolbox. Information here: Run MATLAB Functions on a GPU . One of the most common use of GPUs with and Julia is for machine learning or deep learning.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"advanced/gpus/#gpus-on-c3se-uppmax-hpc2n-lunarc-nsc-and-pdc-systems","text":"There are generally either not GPUs on the login nodes or they cannot be accessed for computations.

Must be used for a job that use many different nodes, for example, a weather prediction. Can also be used within a node. Types \u00b6 A standard API for distributed computing is the Message Passing Interface (MPI) . In general, MPI requires refactoring of your code. External libraries (loaded as modules on the cluster) There are two common versions OpenMPI MPICH (on Dardel) In the distributed parallelization scheme the workers (processes) can share some common memory but they can also exchange information by sending and receiving messages for instance. This is often built-in or written in the actual language (R, MATLAB, Julia Summary \u00b6 Distributed memory Tasks doing individual work Memory sent \u201con-demand\u201d between the tasks with rather small \u201cpackages\u201d Suitable for not very memory-dependent tasks Distributed programming, 2 implementations Native language, packages called \u201cdistributed\u201d or \u201cparallel\u201d (or similar) Message Passing Interface (MPI) relying on external libraries Key words tasks processes workers Important Cores are physical units on a node.

MATLAB: choose between threads and processes Arnold (at the left): a robot that was controlled by MPI How it is used in programming languages of this course? \u00b6 Language-specific nuances for distributed programming R Matlab Julia R doesn\u2019t have a multiprocessing mechanism as the other languages discussed in this course. Some functions provided by certain packages (parallel, doParallel, etc.), for instance, foreach , offer parallel features. The processes generated by these functions have their own workspace which could lead to data replication . MPI is supported in R through the Rmpi package. In Matlab one can use the parpool('my-cluster',X) where X is the number of workers. The total number of processes spawned will always be X+1 where the extra process handles the overhead for the rest. See the documentation for parpool from MatWorks. Matlab doesn\u2019t support MPI function calls in Matlab code, it could be used indirectly through mex functions though. The mechanism here is called Julia processes which can be activated by executing a script as follows julia -p X script.jl , where X is the number of processes. Code modifications are required to support the workers. Julia also supports MPI through the package MPI.jl .

More specifically, one divides the integration range in both directions into n bins.

Monitor the usage of resources with tools available at your center, for instance top (UPPMAX), job-usage (HPC2N), or if you\u2019re working in the GUI (e.g. on LUNARC), you can click Parallel and then Monitor Jobs . For job-usage , you can see the job ID if you type squeue --me on a terminal on Kebnekaise.

Create and run a parallel code We have the following code in MATLAB that generates an array of 10000 random numbers and then the sum of all elements is stored in a variable called s : r = rand ( 1 , 10000 ); s = sum ( r ); We want now to repeat these steps (generating the numbers and taking the sum) 6 times so that the steps are run at the same time. Use parfor to parallelize these steps. Once your code is parallelized enclose it in a parpool section and send the job to the queue. Solution % Nr. of workers nworkers = 6 ; % Use parallel pool with 'parfor' parpool ( 'name-of-your-cluster' , nworkers ); % Start parallel pool with nworkers workers myarray = []; % Optional in this exercise to store partial results parfor i = 1 : nworkers r = rand ( 1 , 10000 ); s = sum ( r ); myarray = [ myarray , s ]; end myarray % print out the results from the workers % Clean up the parallel pool delete ( gcp ( 'nocreate' )); Challenge 2.

Some functions provided by certain packages (parallel, doParallel, etc.), for instance, foreach , offer parallel features. The processes generated by these functions have their own workspace which could lead to data replication . MPI is supported in R through the Rmpi package. In Matlab one can use the parpool('my-cluster',X) where X is the number of workers. The total number of processes spawned will always be X+1 where the extra process handles the overhead for the rest. See the documentation for parpool from MatWorks. Matlab doesn\u2019t support MPI function calls in Matlab code, it could be used indirectly through mex functions though. The mechanism here is called Julia processes which can be activated by executing a script as follows julia -p X script.jl , where X is the number of processes.

Your calculation may take longer than that. One technique that may work is to use parallel computing, where one uses multiple CPU cores to work together on a same calculation HPC cluster architecture \u00b6 Here is a simplified picture of HPC cluster architecture: flowchart TD subgraph hpc_cluster[HPC cluster] subgraph node_1[Node] subgraph cpu_1_1[CPU] core_1_1_1[Core] end end end Term What it loosely is Amount Core Something that does a calculation One or more per CPU CPU A collection of cores that share the same memory One or more per node Node A collection of CPUs that share the same memory One or more per HPC cluster HPC cluster A collection of nodes One or more per universe The universe [1] A collection of HPC clusters One [1] this is a pun to distributed parallelism Simplifications used 1 core is 1 worker is 1 thread is 1 procedure is 1 task Why do we use this simplification? Because we start from the assumption that we are reasonably smart, i.e. we will run as much threads as we have cores. There is an exercise where this assumption is broken. Types of \u2018doing more things at the same time\u2019 \u00b6 There are many types of \u2018doing more things at the same time\u2019. One way to distinguish these, is to separate these on the extent of the parallelism: Extent Parallelism Core Single-threaded (you already do this) Node Thread parallelism (this session) HPC cluster Distributed parallelism (next session) The universe Distributed parallelism Today, we will extend your toolkit from a single-threaded calculation (you already do this) to thread parallelism. The ideal effectiveness of parallelism \u00b6 Before going into details, we will look at the effectiveness of parallelism in the most optimal case, with the goal that you can determine if it is worth it. By now, you can probably guess that parallel computing spreads a calculation over multiple things that can calculate. Imagine a calculation that takes 16 time units, represented as this: Figure 2: a calculation of 16 time units run on 1 core, following the legend below: Square A unit of calculation time that \u2026 cannot be run in parallel can be run in parallel is spent doing nothing This calculation time is expressed in a time unit such as seconds and hence, can be split up into smaller blocks. Using 2 calculation units, this results in: Figure 2: a calculation of 16 time units run on 2 cores, where square is a time unit of calculation. This takes the calculation down from 16 to 10 time units. The so-called \u2018speedup\u2019 of using two workers is 16 / 10 = 1.6. How did you calculate the speedup exactly? Following [Hennessy and Patterson, 2011] (section 1.8), the speedup n (as in the sentence \u2018X is n times faster than Y\u2019) equals: n = t_y / t_x where: t_x is the time the new/enhanced process takes t_y is the time the regular/unenhanced process takes In this context, the \u2018new/enhanced process\u2019 is the calculation performed by multiple cores. Do not be confused by another version of Amdahl\u2019s Law, that is expressed and the calculation units used (and where the numerator and denominator are swapped): n = performance_x / performance_y where: performance_x is the performance (e.g. tasks completed per time unit) the new/enhanced process does performance_y is the performance of the regular process Isn\u2019t that Gustafson\u2019s Law? Not directly. We do use the same term \u2018speedup\u2019 as is calculated in Gustafson\u2019s Law, yet we apply it to compare between a single-core and a multi-core process. Gustafson\u2019s Law predict the maximum speedup, which is S = s + (p * N) = N - ((N - 1) * s) = 1 + ((N - 1) * p) S is the speedup s is fraction of the calculation that cannot be parallelized. The \u2018s\u2019 stands \u2018serial\u2019 p is fraction of the calculation that can be parallelized N is the number of workers, in our case: cores However, 4 (out of 20) calculations units are spent waiting. This means that 16 / 20 = 80% of the calculation time is spent efficiently. How did you calculate the efficiency exactly? The efficiency, f , equals: f = t_used_effectively / t_total` where: t_used_effectively is the time spend on a calculation, summed up over all cores t_total is the total time all spent by all cores These two can be calculated as such: t_used_effectively = (p + s) + (p * (N - 1)) t_total = time * N where: s is fraction of the calculation that cannot be parallelized. The \u2018s\u2019 stands \u2018serial\u2019 p is fraction of the calculation that can be parallelized N is the number of workers, in our case: cores Here one can see this calculation for more cores: Program runtime Number of cores Time Speedup Efficiency 1 16 16 / 16 = 100% 16 / 16 = 100% 2 10 16 / 10 = 160% (10 + 6) / (10 * 2) = 16 / 20 = 80% 3 8 16 / 8 = 200% (10 + 4 + 4) / (10 * 3) = 60% 4 7 16 / 7 = 229% (10 + 3 + 3 + 3) / (10 * 4) = 48% 6 6 16 / 6 = 267% (10 + (2^5)) / (10 * 6) = 70% . 12 5 16 / 5 = .% (10 + (1^11)) / (10 * 12) = 10% . 24 4.5 16 / 4.5 = .% (10 + (0.5^23)) / (10 * 24) = 34 / 50 = 68% . 48 4.25 16 / 4.25 = .% (10 + (0.25^47)) / (10 * 48) = 34 / 50 = 68% The best possible speed gain (as shown here) is called Amdahl\u2019s Law (inspired by [Amdahl, 1967] ) and, in a general form, is plotted like this: Exercises \u00b6 Question -1: change your Zoom name \u00b6 Change your Zoom name, to include your HPC cluster and favorite programming language, e.g. make Sven into Sven [Alvis, R] . You can do so by right-click on the video of yourself, then click \u2018Rename\u2019 to change your Zoom name. Question 0: remember your Zoom room \u00b6 HPC cluster name Main breakout room Alvis Room 1 Bianca Room 2 COSMOS Room 3 Dardel Room 4 Kebnekaise Room 5 LUMI Room 6 Pelle Room 7 Rackham Room 8 Tetralith Room 9 Question 1 \u00b6 Which of the lines in the graph of Amdahl\u2019s Law corresponds with the worked-out example of 16 time units? Answer The red dotted line. Using a different unit (i.e. \u2018relative speed\u2019, instead of \u2018speedup\u2019) was done on purpose. It is easy to convert between the two: just take the inverse (i.e. divide 1 by the value you have) Question 2 \u00b6 In the example of 16 time units, what is the shortest amount of time that can be spent on the calculation, given infinite resources? Answer The length of the calculation that cannot be run in parallel, which is 4 time units. Question 3 \u00b6 In the example of 16 time units, what is the maximal possible speedup? Answer 400%, as the calculation takes 16 units of work on a single core, and 4 time units on an infinite amount of cores. In mathematical form, the speedup, S , equals: S = t_regular / t_enhanced S = 16 / 4 S = 4 S = 400% where: t_enhanced is the time the enhanced process takes t_regular is the time the regular/unenhanced process takes Question 4 \u00b6 For your research project, you need to run a lot of calculations. Each calculation takes 10 hours. How do you make optimal use of your computational resources? Answer Run the calculation on a single core for 100% efficiency Question 5 \u00b6 For your research project, you also have a calculation that takes 11 days. Your HPC cluster allows a calculation of at most 10 days. Assume your HPC center will not extend your job (they will probably do so when asked: we are there to help!). How do you make optimal use of your computational resources? Answer If your calculation already has parallelism built-in, then run the calculation on two cores: this only involves changing your Slurm script, with a low loss of computational resources. If you are a really tight on computational resources, you can implement a \u2018save state\u2019 in your calculation, so that you can schedule two runs of nine days in succession, each with 100% efficiency. Alternatively, you can added thread parallelism to allow running with multiple cores. Question 6 \u00b6 Your colleague runs many jobs with a lot of cores. \u2018It is way faster!\u2019, he/she states. That same colleague, however, also complains about long waiting times before his/her jobs start. How would you explain this situation? Answer The colleague used up (or: \u2018wasted\u2019) all his/her computational resources (commonly 10,000 core hours per month on UPPMAX). Due to this, his/her jobs are only run when the HPC cluster has a low workload and activates the so-called \u2018bonus queue\u2019 (UPPMAX) or generally have to wait for their priority to go up again. Question 7 \u00b6 Your colleague has also done the exercises in this session and decided to measure the same features of her code. Below you can see the plots produced by this benchmark. What seemed to be the percentage of his/her code that could be run in parallel? Total core seconds Efficiency Speedup Benchmark: the total core seconds per number of workers Benchmark: Efficiency per number of workers Benchmark: Speedup per number of workers Answer It is unknown what portion of the code can be run in parallel. Instead, this benchmark shows how it looks if code is run in single-thread mode. In this case, the colleague forgot that the number of threads used must be specified when calling Julia. Note that these plots are less clear than you may have expected: The total core seconds is expected to increase linearily The efficiency is expected to follow the dashed line The speedup is expected to be at 100% It may be unexpected that also in computer science, results can be messier than you would expect :-) References \u00b6 [Amdahl, 1967] Amdahl, Gene M. \u201cValidity of the single processor approach to achieving large scale computing capabilities.\u201d Proceedings of the April 18-20, 1967, spring joint computer conference. 1967.

By now, you can probably guess that parallel computing spreads a calculation over multiple things that can calculate. Imagine a calculation that takes 16 time units, represented as this: Figure 2: a calculation of 16 time units run on 1 core, following the legend below: Square A unit of calculation time that \u2026 cannot be run in parallel can be run in parallel is spent doing nothing This calculation time is expressed in a time unit such as seconds and hence, can be split up into smaller blocks. Using 2 calculation units, this results in: Figure 2: a calculation of 16 time units run on 2 cores, where square is a time unit of calculation. This takes the calculation down from 16 to 10 time units. The so-called \u2018speedup\u2019 of using two workers is 16 / 10 = 1.6. How did you calculate the speedup exactly? Following [Hennessy and Patterson, 2011] (section 1.8), the speedup n (as in the sentence \u2018X is n times faster than Y\u2019) equals: n = t_y / t_x where: t_x is the time the new/enhanced process takes t_y is the time the regular/unenhanced process takes In this context, the \u2018new/enhanced process\u2019 is the calculation performed by multiple cores. Do not be confused by another version of Amdahl\u2019s Law, that is expressed and the calculation units used (and where the numerator and denominator are swapped): n = performance_x / performance_y where: performance_x is the performance (e.g. tasks completed per time unit) the new/enhanced process does performance_y is the performance of the regular process Isn\u2019t that Gustafson\u2019s Law? Not directly. We do use the same term \u2018speedup\u2019 as is calculated in Gustafson\u2019s Law, yet we apply it to compare between a single-core and a multi-core process. Gustafson\u2019s Law predict the maximum speedup, which is S = s + (p * N) = N - ((N - 1) * s) = 1 + ((N - 1) * p) S is the speedup s is fraction of the calculation that cannot be parallelized.

The goal of the benchmark script is to do a fixed unit of work with increasingly more cores. As the script itself only does light calculations, you can run it directly. Here is how to call the script: bash benchmark_2d_integration.sh [ account ] [ language ] Why not call the script with ./benchmark_2d_integration.sh ? Because that would require one extra step: to make the script executable. For example: bash benchmark_2d_integration.sh staff r If you use the incorrect spelling, the script will help you. Slurm script \u00b6 This is the script that schedules a job with thread parallelism. The goal of the script is to submit a calculation that uses thread parallelism, with a custom amount of cores. This Slurm script is called by the benchmark script, i.e. not directly by a user. If the Slurm script is absent, the benchmark script will (try to) download it for you. How do I run it anyways? You do not, instead you will run the benchmark script below. However, you can run it as such: sbatch -A [ account ] -n [ number_of_cores ] do_ [ language ] _2d_integration.sh For example: sbatch -A staff -n 1 do_r_2d_integration.sh # On Dardel sbatch -A staff -n 1 -p main do_r_2d_integration.sh There are 3 Slurm scripts, 1 per language: Language Script with calculation Julia do_julia_2d_integration.sh MATLAB do_matlab_2d_integration.sh R do_r_2d_integration.sh Each of these Slurm scripts are called by the benchmark script, where the benchmark script supplies the desired number of cores. Language script \u00b6 This is the code (in your favorite language) that performs a job with thread parallelism. The goal of the language script is to have a fixed unit of work that can be done by a custom amount of cores. This language script is called by the Slurm script, i.e. not directly by a user. If the language script is absent, the benchmark script will (try to) download it for you. How do I run it anyways? Check the Slurm script for your favorite language. In general, you can run it as such: [ interpreter ] [ script_name ] [ number_of_cores ] [ grid_size ] On a login node, use 1 core and a grid size of 1 to start the lightest calculation possible: julia integration2d.jl 1 1 Rscript integration2d.R 1 1 Language Script with calculation Julia do_2d_integration.jl MATLAB do_2d_integration.m R do_2d_integration.R Exercises \u00b6 Exercise 1: start the benchmark on your HPC cluster \u00b6 The goal of this exercise is to start the benchmark script on your HPC cluster, as well as some troubleshooting. On your HPC cluster: Download the benchmark script How to do that? There are many ways to do so. One way is to download it directly from this course\u2019s repository : wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UPPMAX/R-matlab-julia-HPC/refs/heads/main/docs/advanced/thread_parallelism/benchmark_2d_integration.sh Run the benchmark script. Tip: see the \u2018Benchmark script\u2019 section . How to do that? The \u2018Benchmark script\u2019 section shows how: bash benchmark_2d_integration.sh staff r You can use our projects overview page to find the course NAISS project for your HPC cluster. Check the Slurm output files for problems. If there are problems: fix these, then run the benchmark script again How to do that? There are many ways to do so. One way is to show all files with the .out extension: cat *.out Exercise 2: read the benchmark script \u00b6 Now that the benchmark script is running, we have the time to figure out what it is doing. What is the most important single line in this script, i.e. the line it is all about? Tip: start looking from the bottom of the script Answer For all HPC clusters except Dardel: sbatch -A \" ${ slurm_job_account } \" -N \" ${ n_nodes } \" -n \" ${ n_cores } \" \" ${ slurm_script_name } \" For the Dardel HPC cluster: sbatch -A \" ${ slurm_job_account } \" -N \" ${ n_nodes } \" --ntasks \" ${ n_cores } \" -p shared \" ${ slurm_script_name } \" In English, describe what the line does in general terms Answer Schedule to run \u2026 on some account with some amount of nodes with some amount of cores (on Dardel) on the main partition a script with some name This line of code is part of a for loop. In English, what does the for loop achieve? Answer The for loop achieves that the same calculation is scheduled to be done with 1 core, then with 2 cores, then with 3 cores, etc., to 64 cores. Exercise 3: read the Slurm script \u00b6 The benchmark script submits a Slurm script of your favorite language multiple times to the queue: once with 1 cores, once with 2 cores, etc. What is the most important single line in this script, i.e. the line it is all about? Tip: start looking from the bottom of the script Answer The last line. Language Most important line Julia julia --threads \"${SLURM_NPROCS}\" do_2d_integration.jl \"${SLURM_NPROCS}\" MATLAB matlab -nodisplay -nosplash -nojvm -batch \"run(\\\"${matlab_target_filename}\\\"); exit;\" R Rscript --no-save --no-restore do_2d_integration.R \"${SLURM_NPROCS}\" In English, describe what the line does in general terms. Tip: this is the same answer for all programming languages. Tip 2: assume \u2018procedure\u2019 is synonym for \u2018core\u2019. Tip 3: the Julia line is closest to English. Answer Run a Julia/MATLAB/R script for the booked number of cores, without doing anything else (e.g. showing a splash screen or restoring a computational environment). Exercise 4: read the language script \u00b6 The Slurm script runs a script of your favorite language for a specified number of cores. Locate the lines of code that make the calculation perform in parallel. Answer Julia MATLAB R Threads . @threads for worker_index = 1 : n_workers results [ worker_index ] = integration2d ( grid_size , n_workers , worker_index ) end parfor worker_index = 1 : n_workers partial_results ( worker_index ) = integration2d ( grid_size , n_workers , worker_index ); end results_of_workers <- foreach ( worker_index = 1 : n_workers , .combine = c ) %dopar% { integration2d ( grid_size , n_workers , worker_index ) } In English, describe what these lines does in general terms. Answer For each available worker: per worker, do part of a calculation and combine the results Optional: what is grid_size ? What does it do? What would be a better variable name? Answer grid_size determines the accuracy of the calculation: the bigger grid_size , the smaller intervals will be integrated. A better variable name could be accuracy . However, with such a variable name, there is no natural understanding that the range of its value goes from 1 to infinity. For the name grid_size , this range is easier to feel right, as sizes are non-zero positive values by nature Locate the keyword that make the calculation perform in parallel. Or: locate the word that, when removed, would \u2018downgrade\u2019 the calculation to be single-threaded. Answer The last line. Language Keyword to indicate a parallel calculation Julia Threads.@threads MATLAB parfor R %dopar% The function that is run in parallel (i.e. integration2d ) is made suitable to be run in parallel. In English, describe which changes are made to make it suitable. Answer The function has three (instead of one) arguments: Language Function signature Julia function integration2d(grid_size::Int, n_workers::Int, worker_index::Int) MATLAB function integration2d(grid_size, n_workers, worker_index) R integration2d <- function(grid_size, n_workers, worker_index) The extra arguments are n_workers and worker_index . These allow the worker_index -th worker to know which share of the calculation it must do. What do these changes achieve? Answer These changes allow each thread to know what it needs to know to run its part of the calculation. Bonus: do you spot the bug in integrate2d ? Is this a problem? Why would someone keep it in anyways? Answer The calculation of begin_index and end_index : Julia MATLAB R workload = fld ( grid_size , n_workers ) begin_index = workload * ( worker_index - 1 ) + 1 end_index = workload * worker_index grid_cells_per_worker = floor ( grid_size / n_workers ); begin_index = grid_cells_per_worker * ( worker_index - 1 ) + 1 ; end_index = grid_cells_per_worker * worker_index ; grid_cells_per_worker <- floor ( grid_size / n_workers ) begin_index <- grid_cells_per_worker * ( worker_index - 1 ) + 1 end_index <- grid_cells_per_worker * worker_index To most clearly demonstrate this, imagine a grid_size of 3 for an n_workers of 2: Variable name Value grid_size 3 n_workers 2 grid_cells_per_worker 3 / 2 (rounded down) = 1 begin_index for first worker 1 * (1 - 1) + 1 = 1 end_index for first worker 1 * 1 = 1 begin_index for second worker 1 * (2 - 1) + 1 = 2 end_index for second worker 1 * 2 = 2 This means that, although the calculation is split in 3 parts, only 2 of these are performed. For bigger grid sizes, however, this problem gets less. One would keep such a bug in for readability: this session is about thread parallelism, not about the extensive calculation of these indices. Exercise 5: share the results \u00b6 By now, some of the calculations in exercise 1 will be finished. If not: no worries, just continue! In the terminal on your favorite HPC cluster, run the following command to collect all results: grep -EoRh \"^[jmlr].*,.*\" --include = *.out | sort | uniq Copy-paste these results to our shared HackMD document . Exercise 6: analyse the results \u00b6 Take it easy Doing this analysis yourself is useful, if you are fluent in analysing data. If not, you are encouraged to use: This spreadsheet This R script Copy-paste the results of the previous exercise into a comma-separated file called my_results.csv . These are the descriptions of the variables: Parameter Value language Your programming language hpc_cluster Your HPC cluster grid_size Accuracy n_workers Number of cores used core_secs Core seconds used, i.e. the time used by all cores together Load the comma-separated file ( my_results.csv ) in a spreadsheet or read it in your favorite programming language Add a column called wall_clock_sec , which equals core_secs divided by n_workers . wall_clock_sec is the time it took the calculation to complete Add a column called speedup , which equals the wall clock time for 1 core divided by the wall clock time of that amount of cores Plot the speedup (on the y axis) per number of workers (on the x axis). Compare your speedup with the Amdahl\u2019s Law figure of the previous session, above \u2018Exercises\u2019 ). What do you estimate is the maximum speedup? What do you estimate is the percentage of code that can be parallelized (i.e. the \u2018parallel portion\u2019 in the figure of Amdahl\u2019s Law)? Exercise 7: compare to others \u00b6 Compare your results to others, that ran the same benchmark, yet for other HPC clusters and other programming languages: Total core seconds Efficiency Speedup Benchmark: the total core seconds per number of workers Benchmark: Efficiency per number of workers Benchmark: Speedup per number of workers What do you notice? Answer This question is vague on purpose: there are many things going on here and many answers are correct: Measurements are messier than you may have thought Julia is 30x faster than R The MATLAB code is single-threaded R works best at being efficient in parallel HPC clusters differ The points on Kebnekaise differ more than other HPC clusters: this is because Kebnekaise is the most heterogeneous (i.e. has the highest number of different hardware) Exercise X1: job scheduling problem? \u00b6 You have just submitted some multithreaded jobs to the queue. What went wrong here? Why is this a problem?

This means that the cores booked do not have shared memory. This will make the calculation slower, as the results have to be shared by sending data between nodes. Exercise X2: learn a faster programming language? \u00b6 As can be seen in the benchmark, some programming languages are faster than others. This warrants the question: should you learn to program in the programming language that does calculations fastest? The theoretically fastest programming languages allow you to write machine code. Assembler lets you do so directly. Some other languages (most notably C, C++ and Rust) allow you to insert machine code. Hence, these are the theoretically fastest languages. To write fast code, should one learn those languages instead? Below is a figure from [Prechelt, 2000] . It shows the distribution of runtime speeds of a certain problem (called z1000 ), for different programming languages. Take a close look at the figure. The paper has an advice to yes/no learn a \u2018faster\u2019 programming language. What do you think the advice is? Answer The variance within a programming language is bigger than variance between languages (adapted fig 2, from [Prechelt, 2000] ). Instead of learning a faster language, learn how to be fast in your language. Still, the Julia code is 30x faster than the R code. Why would this advice still hold? Answer Because none of the code is optimized for speed. Both Julia and R can call C code, where C is the fastest higher-level language. It would be interesting to see how this benchmark would look like for optimized code. Are there other factors that decide which programming language to use? If yes, name some. Answer There are many reasons why to use a \u2018slower\u2019 programming language: you already know the \u2018slower\u2019 programming language you need access to specific libraries/packages you have colleagues that are willing to teach you you need to to work from code that has been written someone else Where to go next? \u00b6 If you want to scale up, distributed parallelism allows you to do a calculation on many computers.

Answer For each available worker: per worker, do part of a calculation and combine the results Optional: what is grid_size ? What does it do? What would be a better variable name? Answer grid_size determines the accuracy of the calculation: the bigger grid_size , the smaller intervals will be integrated. A better variable name could be accuracy . However, with such a variable name, there is no natural understanding that the range of its value goes from 1 to infinity. For the name grid_size , this range is easier to feel right, as sizes are non-zero positive values by nature Locate the keyword that make the calculation perform in parallel.

Is it right for my job? \u00b6 On Cosmos (LUNARC), Kebnekaise (HPC2N), and Dardel (PDC), some applications are available through one of a couple of On Demand services. On Demand applications provide an interactive environment to schedule jobs on compute nodes using a graphic user interface (GUI) instead of the typical batch submission script. How you reach this interface is dependent on the system you use and their choice of On Demand client. Cosmos and Dardel use the On-Demand Desktop developed at LUNARC, which is accessible via Thinlinc. Kebnekaise uses Open OnDemand 1 via a dedicated web portal at https://portal.hpc2n.umu.se . Desktop On-Demand is most appropriate for interactive work requiring small-to-medium amounts of computing resources. Non-interactive jobs and jobs that take more than a day or so should generally be submitted as batch jobs. If you have a longer job that requires an interactive interface to submit, make sure you keep track of the wall time limits for your facility. On-Demand applications are not accessible via SSH; you must use either Thinlinc (Cosmos and Dardel) or the dedicated web portal (Kebnekaise). On-Demand App Availability for this Course RStudio and MATLAB are both available as On-Demand applications at all 3 facilities covered on this page. On Cosmos, there are also interactive On-Demand command lines (for CPUs and GPUs) under Applications - General that you may want to use with Julia, or that may still let you use RStudio or MATLAB if for some reason those apps fail to start with the more direct methods described below. Tip Batch jobs submitted from within these interactive sessions are not bound by the same job parameters as the On-Demand interface. E.g., if you are in the MATLAB GUI and submit a job with the batch command, the batch job will not be interrupted if the GUI is closed or times out. Thinlinc Access Limited on Dardel (PDC) Here we focus on Cosmos and Kebnekaise because access to Dardel via Thinlinc is severely restricted. Only 30 users total may have an active ThinLinc session at a time, and queue times are very long. Other PDC resources not tested in this course may be more flexible, but if you must run a program on Dardel interactively, it is better to use SSH with X-forwarding (that is, log in with ssh -X <user>@dardel.pdc.kth.se ) and then follow the workflow described in this link . Keep in mind that if you do not need a full node, you can also select a number of cores on Dardel\u2019s shared partition, which may help reduce your time in the queue. See here for information on Dardel partitions . Starting the On-Demand Interface \u00b6 COSMOS (and Dardel) Kebnekaise For most programs, the start-up process is roughly the same: Log into COSMOS (or Dardel) via your usual Thinlinc client or browser interface to start an HPC Desktop session. Click Applications in the top left corner, hover over the items prefixed with Applications - until you find your desired application (on Dardel, On-Demand applications are prefixed with PDC- ), and click it. The top-level Applications menu on Cosmos looks like this: Warning If you start a terminal session or another application from Favorites , System Tools , or other menu headings not prefixed with Applications - or PDC- , and launch an interactive program from that, it will run on a login node. Do not run intensive programs this way! To start an Open OnDemand session on Kebnekaise, Open https://portal.hpc2n.umu.se in your browser. The page looks like this: Click the blue button labeled \u201cLogin to HPC2N OnDemand\u201d. A login window should open with boxes for your login credentials. Enter your HPC2N username and password, then click \u201cSign In\u201d. You will now be on the HPC2N Open OnDemand dashboard. The top of it looks like this: Find the Interactive Apps tab in the menu bar along the top and click it to open a drop-down menu of available apps. The menu currently looks like this: Warning Unlike on Cosmos and Dardel, On-Demand applications on Kebnekaise are not reachable through Thinlinc, regardless of whether you use the desktop client or a browser! If you find similar-looking applications in the Thinlinc interface, be aware that they all run on login nodes! Setting Job Parameters \u00b6 COSMOS (and Dardel) Kebnekaise Upon clicking your chosen application, a pop-up interface called the GfxLauncher will appear and let you set the following options: Wall time - how long your interactive session will remain open. When it ends, the whole window closes immediately and any unsaved work is lost. You can select the time from a drop-down menu, or type in the time manually. On Cosmos, CPU-only applications (indicated with \u201c(CPU)\u201d in the name) can run for up to 168 hours (7 days), but the rest are limited to 48 hours. Default is 30 minutes. Requirements - how many tasks per node you need. The default is usually 1 or 4 tasks per node. There is also a gear icon to the right of this box that can pull up a second menu (see figure below) where you can set the name of your job, the number of tasks per node, the amount of memory per CPU core, and/or whether or not to use a full node. Resource - which kind of node you want in terms of the architecture (AMD or Intel) and number of cores in the CPU (or GPU). Options and defaults vary by program. Project - choose from a drop-down menu the project with which your work is associated. This is mainly to keep your usage in line with your licenses and permissions, and to send any applicable invoices to the correct PI. Licensed software will only work for projects whose group members are covered by the license. The GfxLauncher GUI (here used to launch MATLAB). The box on the left is the basic menu and the box on the right is what pops up when the gear icon next to Requirements is clicked. When you\u2019re happy with your settings, click \u201cStart\u201d. The GfxLauncher menu will stay open in the background so that you can monitor your wall time usage with the Usage bar. Leave this window open\u2014your application depends on it! Warning Closing the GfxLauncher popup after your application starts will kill the application immediately! If you want, you can also look at the associated SLURM scripts by clicking the \u201cMore\u201d button at the bottom of the GfxLauncher menu and clicking the \u201cScript\u201d tab (example below), or view the logs under the \u201cLogg\u201d tab. If an app fails to start, the first step of troubleshooting will always be to check the \u201cLogg\u201d tab. Terminals on Compute nodes If you don\u2019t see the program you want to run interactively listed under any other Applications sub-menus, or if the usual menu item fails to launch the application, you may still be able to launch it via one of the terminals under Applications - General , or the GPU Accelerated Terminal under Applications - Visualization . The CPU terminal allows for a wall time of up to 168 hours (7 days), while the two GPU terminals can only run for 48 hours (2 days) at most. For more on the specifications of the different nodes these terminals can run on, see LUNARC\u2019s webpage on COSMOS . If you finish before your wall time is up and close the app, the app should stop in the GfxLauncher window within a couple of minutes, but you can always force it to stop by clicking the \u201cStop\u201d button. This may be necessary for Jupyter Lab. If you select any of the options under \u201cInteractive apps\u201d, a page will open that looks like this (using RStudio as an example): Most of the options you have to set will be the same whether you choose RStudio Server, MATLAB Proxy, Jupyter Notebook, or even the Kebnekaise desktop. The parameters required for all apps include: Compute Project - Dropdown menu where you can choose (one of) your compute projects to launch with. Number of Hours - Wall time. The maximum is 12 hours, but you should avoid using more than you need to conserve your allocation and minimize queuing time. Node type - Choose from options described below the dropdown menu. If you pick \u201cany GPU\u201d, leave \u201cNumber of Cores\u201d empty. Number of Cores - Choose any number up to 28. Each core has 4GB of memory. This is only a valid field if you pick \u201cany\u201d or \u201cLarge memory\u201d for the \u201cNode type\u201d selection. Working directory - Default is $HOME. You can either type a full path manually or click \u201cSelect Path\u201d to open a file browser if you are unsure of the full path. \u201cI would like to receive an email when my job starts\u201d - Check box if you agree. For some apps, like RStudio and Jupyter Notebook, you will also see an option to choose a Runtime environment. Choose from \u201cSystem provided\u201d, \u201cProject provided\u201d, or \u201cUser provided\u201d. If you or your project do not have a custom environment (with specific Python or R packages, for instance), then use \u201cSystem provided\u201d. Once you enter your desired parameters, click Launch . If the parameters are all valid, the page will reload and looks something like this for as long as your job is in the queue (using RStudio as an example): When the job starts, the title bar of the box containing your job will turn from blue to green, the status message will change from \u201cQueued\u201d to \u201cRunning\u201d, and the number of nodes and cores with appear in the title bar. You can have more than one OnDemand job running or queued. Running jobs will look like these: For all apps, the equivalent of a start button will be a bright blue rectangle near the bottom of the job box, though the words on the button may vary. When you click this button, your app should launch in a new window. Important Closing the GUI window for your app before time runs out (e.g. the MATLAB GUI or the browser for Jupyter Notebook) does not stop your job or release the resources associated with it! If you want to stop your job and avoid spending any more of your resource budget on it, you must click the red \u201cDelete\u201d button near the top right of your interactive job listing. Otherwise, you can reopen any closed app as long as time remains in the job allocated for it. Open OnDemand is a web service that allows HPC users to schedule jobs, run notebooks and work interactively on a remote cluster from any device that supports a modern browser. The Open OnDemand project was funded by NSF and is currently maintained by the Ohio SuperComputing Centre.

On Cosmos, CPU-only applications (indicated with \u201c(CPU)\u201d in the name) can run for up to 168 hours (7 days), but the rest are limited to 48 hours. Default is 30 minutes. Requirements - how many tasks per node you need. The default is usually 1 or 4 tasks per node. There is also a gear icon to the right of this box that can pull up a second menu (see figure below) where you can set the name of your job, the number of tasks per node, the amount of memory per CPU core, and/or whether or not to use a full node. Resource - which kind of node you want in terms of the architecture (AMD or Intel) and number of cores in the CPU (or GPU). Options and defaults vary by program. Project - choose from a drop-down menu the project with which your work is associated. This is mainly to keep your usage in line with your licenses and permissions, and to send any applicable invoices to the correct PI. Licensed software will only work for projects whose group members are covered by the license. The GfxLauncher GUI (here used to launch MATLAB). The box on the left is the basic menu and the box on the right is what pops up when the gear icon next to Requirements is clicked. When you\u2019re happy with your settings, click \u201cStart\u201d. The GfxLauncher menu will stay open in the background so that you can monitor your wall time usage with the Usage bar. Leave this window open\u2014your application depends on it! Warning Closing the GfxLauncher popup after your application starts will kill the application immediately! If you want, you can also look at the associated SLURM scripts by clicking the \u201cMore\u201d button at the bottom of the GfxLauncher menu and clicking the \u201cScript\u201d tab (example below), or view the logs under the \u201cLogg\u201d tab. If an app fails to start, the first step of troubleshooting will always be to check the \u201cLogg\u201d tab. Terminals on Compute nodes If you don\u2019t see the program you want to run interactively listed under any other Applications sub-menus, or if the usual menu item fails to launch the application, you may still be able to launch it via one of the terminals under Applications - General , or the GPU Accelerated Terminal under Applications - Visualization . The CPU terminal allows for a wall time of up to 168 hours (7 days), while the two GPU terminals can only run for 48 hours (2 days) at most. For more on the specifications of the different nodes these terminals can run on, see LUNARC\u2019s webpage on COSMOS . If you finish before your wall time is up and close the app, the app should stop in the GfxLauncher window within a couple of minutes, but you can always force it to stop by clicking the \u201cStop\u201d button. This may be necessary for Jupyter Lab. If you select any of the options under \u201cInteractive apps\u201d, a page will open that looks like this (using RStudio as an example): Most of the options you have to set will be the same whether you choose RStudio Server, MATLAB Proxy, Jupyter Notebook, or even the Kebnekaise desktop. The parameters required for all apps include: Compute Project - Dropdown menu where you can choose (one of) your compute projects to launch with. Number of Hours - Wall time. The maximum is 12 hours, but you should avoid using more than you need to conserve your allocation and minimize queuing time. Node type - Choose from options described below the dropdown menu. If you pick \u201cany GPU\u201d, leave \u201cNumber of Cores\u201d empty. Number of Cores - Choose any number up to 28. Each core has 4GB of memory. This is only a valid field if you pick \u201cany\u201d or \u201cLarge memory\u201d for the \u201cNode type\u201d selection. Working directory - Default is $HOME. You can either type a full path manually or click \u201cSelect Path\u201d to open a file browser if you are unsure of the full path. \u201cI would like to receive an email when my job starts\u201d - Check box if you agree. For some apps, like RStudio and Jupyter Notebook, you will also see an option to choose a Runtime environment. Choose from \u201cSystem provided\u201d, \u201cProject provided\u201d, or \u201cUser provided\u201d. If you or your project do not have a custom environment (with specific Python or R packages, for instance), then use \u201cSystem provided\u201d. Once you enter your desired parameters, click Launch . If the parameters are all valid, the page will reload and looks something like this for as long as your job is in the queue (using RStudio as an example): When the job starts, the title bar of the box containing your job will turn from blue to green, the status message will change from \u201cQueued\u201d to \u201cRunning\u201d, and the number of nodes and cores with appear in the title bar. You can have more than one OnDemand job running or queued. Running jobs will look like these: For all apps, the equivalent of a start button will be a bright blue rectangle near the bottom of the job box, though the words on the button may vary. When you click this button, your app should launch in a new window. Important Closing the GUI window for your app before time runs out (e.g. the MATLAB GUI or the browser for Jupyter Notebook) does not stop your job or release the resources associated with it! If you want to stop your job and avoid spending any more of your resource budget on it, you must click the red \u201cDelete\u201d button near the top right of your interactive job listing. Otherwise, you can reopen any closed app as long as time remains in the job allocated for it. Open OnDemand is a web service that allows HPC users to schedule jobs, run notebooks and work interactively on a remote cluster from any device that supports a modern browser. The Open OnDemand project was funded by NSF and is currently maintained by the Ohio SuperComputing Centre.

It\u2019s not possible to fit in all your superb infos from the material in the course itself For some tasks, there was too much time allocated, for example for the pip installs at the start. I would suggest checking in with students more frequently about if they are done or not, and then continuing. Or students could be instructed to join the main room again when they are done. This way, if someone takes longer, you could see who is left in the breakout rooms and check in with them. Lectures should be given more time (or the contents reduced). Unfortunately it was at times a hard to follow. Perhaps, also, make it a bit more clear what is expected from the exercises. It looked like everything was rushed up and it was not clear what we were supposed to do in the breakout rooms Create one single entrance point for all the material where links to the rest are to be found. I got lost with five or more different links, folders and the information overflow as it got started. I also missed the big picture of the super computer (no previous experience), how the different systems are related, the main difference of Rackham and hp2cn/kebnekaise and so on. I felt I have too little information to make informed choices. For example, it would be easier if everybody used the same server, and only one\u2026 Much more time spent on code along and instructions, this would improve the course a lot I think! I understand and respect that for you this is very clear and it flows really easily. But for us who is watching over zoom: scrolling up and down fast while screen sharing makes it impossible to follow; as it is over zoom the instructions for the exercise part needs to be much clearer in my view, also do this - BEFORE - entering breakout rooms; additional thought about exercises is what really are the exercises, the ones stated at the end of each lecture part or the text/instructions embedded in the \u2018slides\u2019 in the instruction pages; the \u2018messages\u2019 that can be sent out to the breakout rooms are hard to notice sometimes while working on exercise, perhaps paste this in chat and/or document so one can re-read; please specify clearly how long a task \u2018should\u2019 take approx. (is the whole time in breakout rooms dedicated to the assigned task, or is the time also there for break); specify in start of each part/\u2018lecture\u2019 what the plan is maybe?; \u2018slides\u2019 can be a bit clearer I would say.

Too much time in break rooms in general, and then other sections got rushed.

By the end it was a bit long but it clarified a lot of concepts for me It was good! I am happy with the pace Good For me, it was a little too fast The pace is very appropriate, although I couldn\u2019t really follow the ML part as it was out of my area of expertise Question 3: Confidences \u00b6 As table: average_confidence_per_question.csv Coding scheme: Column text Description NA I did not attend that session 0 I have no confidence I can do this 1 I have low confidence I can do this 2 I have some confidence I can do this 3 I have good confidence I can do this 4 I can absolutely do this!

And secondly, I\u2019m 99% sure it should be reasonably straightforward, but it might be nice for there to be a little extra note on best practices for installing and using STAN for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). R, Julia and MATLAB can work with STAN, and because MCMC is such a slow process, I can imagine that this could be helpful. Question 6: Do you have any additional comments? \u00b6 Suggestions/ideas: For some portions of this course it was a bit unclear when/what to do hands-on. The course documentation is very good and will help me the most in the future. I really liked the materials and the web page. It was extremely helpful, and I have bookmarked the course page because it is easier to use than all the official documentation. The exercises were well-prepared, although the parallel processing section was less good on both the web page, and the exercise code needed a bit of editing to get it to work. The organization was great - however the initial email maybe didn\u2019t make it quite clear enough that setting up a login account could take many days. I happened to already have one, but sitting the day before to try to set up, I could easily have missed that. I really appreciate the amount of hands-on demonstrations: they were great. Only a very, very small comment is that it was not always clear which .sh file was appropriate for the relevant exercises, for instance serial and parallel at the start. The exercises might be named with the same names, which would make it easier to find them. But this is such a small complaint. The whole material for the day was excellent, and I\u2019m feeling extremely confident about moving forward with getting started. I had some issues with my account not being set up correctly, which set me behind for the whole course and meant there were some things I couldn\u2019t test myself as they were being explained. This was not the fault of the course facilitators, but did make the course less useful for me. I liked the exercises best, makes it easy to understand how you can directly apply. I would have appreciated more time for them though.

The course documentation is very good and will help me the most in the future. I really liked the materials and the web page. It was extremely helpful, and I have bookmarked the course page because it is easier to use than all the official documentation. The exercises were well-prepared, although the parallel processing section was less good on both the web page, and the exercise code needed a bit of editing to get it to work. The organization was great - however the initial email maybe didn\u2019t make it quite clear enough that setting up a login account could take many days. I happened to already have one, but sitting the day before to try to set up, I could easily have missed that. I really appreciate the amount of hands-on demonstrations: they were great. Only a very, very small comment is that it was not always clear which .sh file was appropriate for the relevant exercises, for instance serial and parallel at the start. The exercises might be named with the same names, which would make it easier to find them. But this is such a small complaint. The whole material for the day was excellent, and I\u2019m feeling extremely confident about moving forward with getting started. I had some issues with my account not being set up correctly, which set me behind for the whole course and meant there were some things I couldn\u2019t test myself as they were being explained. This was not the fault of the course facilitators, but did make the course less useful for me. I liked the exercises best, makes it easy to understand how you can directly apply. I would have appreciated more time for them though.

Run a serial script"},{"location":"julia/environments_packages/","text":"Managing environments and packages \u00b6 Learning outcomes for this session How to work with Julia\u2019s environment and package management. How to check for and use site-installed packages, if any. Your background? Have you used Python? Have you used Matlab? Were you at yesterdays Matlab sessions? Have you used Git? Are you completely new to this, code packages and version control? Key points Environments Project Version control Nested, base, tools not part of the project, use with caution Packages Introduction \u00b6 Packages are pieces of software to be used by your scripts or interactive sessions as-is or modified, stand-alone or\u2014most often\u2014in combinations to make a full toolkit customized to your task. Such a toolkit may itself become a new package. Packages allow us to cooperate on code that can be useful in several places. Environments are sets of packages that are available for use simultaneously and, if all is right, work together. If you come from Python, you have likely seen that there are several different ways to deal with environments and package management in this language, for instance, conda and pip . The situation can be described as several ecosystems of packages. You may have come across the term \u201cdependency hell\u201d or even had a taste (or perhaps far more than you could stomach) of this yourself. Julia comes with a great system for environments and packages included. As a result there is essentially a single ecosystem of packages and \u201cdependency hell\u201d is as close to eliminated as it can be. Julia environments are defined by two TOML (Tom\u2019s Obvious Minimal Language) files, Project.toml and Manifest.toml . The former specifies which packages you\u2019ve asked for, the latter specifies all packages loaded including their exact versions. Include both of these files ( Project.toml all the time, Manifest.toml at points for which you want exact reproducibility) in your version control and you get traceable, reproducible environments with minimal effort! Getting started \u00b6 To get started we will go to the Julia documentation and make use of the official tutorial on the Julia package manager: https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/#Pkg Summary of what we\u2019ve seen so far \u00b6 Get to the Pkg REPL by pressing ] in the Julia REPL In the Pkg REPL, use the following commands: ? to get help activate to activate an existing or new environment st (alias for status ) to see which packages have been added to the active environment add to add packages to the active environment, this may or may not have download and precompilation steps that take a bit of time rm (alias for remove ) to remove packages from the active environment up (alias for update ) to update packages in the active environment Project.toml stores what packages you\u2019ve asked for Manifest.toml stores how Pkg resolved this, with all dependencies and exact versions Environment stacking When you have not activated any specific environment, the active environment is your personal base environment for the Julia version you\u2019re currently running (called e.g. @v1.11). This is normally reachable in addition to your active environment. This can be a convenient way to access development tools that you want active but your project does not depend on . If you have tools available through your base environment and you need to check that your project can be reproduced properly without your base environment, you\u2019ll want to read this: Loading project environment only The full stack of reachable environments are defined by the global Julia variable LOAD_PATH : julia>LOAD_PATH 3-element Vector{String}: \"@\" \"@v#.#\" \"@stdlib\" where @ is the active environment, @v#.# is your base environment for the Julia version in use, and @stdlib is the standard library. To include just the current environment we can modify the LOAD_PATH variable from the julian prompt with the following functions: julia> empty!(LOAD_PATH) # this will clean out the path julia> push!(LOAD_PATH, \"@\") # this will add the current environment Choosing package versions \u00b6 ] add < package > @< version > Example: ] add DataFrames @ 1.1 But where are the packages installed? \u00b6 Each environment only consists of two files, the code is not here. Packages will be installed to and loaded from paths defined by the global Julia variable DEPOT_PATH . In a Julia installation on the clusters this will by default be set to: ~/.julia where ~ is the user home as appropriate on the system. If Julia is installed centrally On a local system like a personal linux computer or if Julia would have been installed at a \u201csystem level\u201d and not i a module system an architecture-specific shared system directory, e.g. /usr/local/share/julia ; an architecture-independent shared system directory, e.g. /usr/share/julia . Packages can consist of relatively many files and some clusters have a limit on the number of files you can have in your home directory. If this becomes a problem, you can set the DEPOT_PATH to a Project folder Non-interactive use of Pkg \u00b6 We\u2019ve seen how to use Pkg interactively, with its special REPL mode. All the functions of Pkg can also be used by loading the Pkg module and calling its functions just like any other module. On the clusters, this is especially useful for activating or even setting up an environment from inside a Julia script, so that you can run it in a batch job. For example: activate the environment of the current folder by calling these two lines in your .jl file: using Pkg Pkg . activate ( \".\" ) Besides the previous two options for activating an environment, you can also activate it on the Linux command line (assuming that you are located in the environment directory): julia --project=. Bianca At Bianca there is a central library with installed packages. You may control the present \u201ccentral library\u201d by typing ml help julia/<version> in the BASH shell. A possibly more up-to-date status can be found from the Julia shell: julia> using Pkg julia> Pkg . activate ( DEPOT_PATH [ 2 ] * \"/environments/v1.8\" ); #change version (1.8) accordingly if you have another main version of Julia julia> Pkg . status () julia> Pkg . activate ( DEPOT_PATH [ 1 ] * \"/environments/v1.8\" ); #to return to user library A selection of the Julia packages and libraries installed on Bianca are: - BenchmarkTools - CSV - CUDA - MPI - Distributed - IJulia - Plots - PyPlot - Gadfly - DataFrames - DistributedArrays - PlotlyJS Site-installed packages in environments At Bianca the central environment adds to the environment stack: julia> LOAD_PATH 4-element Vector{String}: \"@\" \"@v#.#\" \"@stdlib\" \"/sw/comp/julia/1.8.5/rackham/lib/glob_pkg/environments/v1.8\" Bianca Intermediate workshop Info page Course material Julia on Bianca Exercises \u00b6 We need the packages IJulia and Pluto for running the integrated development environments (IDEs) Jupyter and Pluto. We also need the MPI package on Friday. Make these exercises be the installation of the packages that we will later use. It might be advisable to install IJulia and Pluto in separate environments.

Project environment with csv Create a project environment called new-env and activate it. Then, install the package CSV in this environment. For your knowledge, CSV is a package that offers tools for dealing with .csv files. After this, check that this package was installed. Finally, deactivate the environment. Solution for all centres ``` julia shell> mkdir new-env shell> cd new-env (@v1.8) pkg> activate . Activating new project at `path-to-folder\\new-env` (new-env) pkg> add CSV (new-env) pkg> status Status `path-to-folder\\new-env\\Project.toml` [336ed68f] CSV v0.10.9 (new-env) pkg> deactivate ``` Summary Environments in Julia created by Julia itself so third party software are not required. With a virtual environment you can tailor an environment with specific versions for Julia and packages, not interfering with other installed Julia versions and packages. Make it for each project you have for reproducibility. The environments in Julia are lightweight so it is recommended to start a new environment for each project that you are developing.

Project environment with csv Create a project environment called new-env and activate it. Then, install the package CSV in this environment. For your knowledge, CSV is a package that offers tools for dealing with .csv files. After this, check that this package was installed. Finally, deactivate the environment. Solution for all centres ``` julia shell> mkdir new-env shell> cd new-env (@v1.8) pkg> activate . Activating new project at `path-to-folder\\new-env` (new-env) pkg> add CSV (new-env) pkg> status Status `path-to-folder\\new-env\\Project.toml` [336ed68f] CSV v0.10.9 (new-env) pkg> deactivate ``` Summary Environments in Julia created by Julia itself so third party software are not required. With a virtual environment you can tailor an environment with specific versions for Julia and packages, not interfering with other installed Julia versions and packages. Make it for each project you have for reproducibility. The environments in Julia are lightweight so it is recommended to start a new environment for each project that you are developing.

But this should only be done for shorter jobs or jobs that do not use a lot of resources, as the login nodes can otherwise become slow for all users. If you want to work interactively with your code or data, you should start an interactive session. If you rather will run a script which won\u2019t use any interactive user input while running, you can instead start a batch job, see next session. There are several ways to run Julia interactively General \u00b6 In order to run interactively, you need to have compute nodes allocated to run on, and this is done through the Slurm system. Interactive sessions at NSC, PDC, HPC2N, UPPMAX and LUNARC \u00b6 Here we define an interactive session as a session with direct access to a compute node. Or alternatively: an interactive session is a session, in which there is no queue before a command is run on a compute node. This differs between HPC2N and UPPMAX : HPC2N: the user remains on a login node. All commands can be sent directly to the compute node using srun UPPMAX: the user is actually on a computer node. Whatever command is done, it is run on the compute node LUNARC: the user is actually on a computer node if the correct menu option is chosen. Whatever command is done, it is run on the compute node NSC: the user is actually on a computer node if the correct menu option is chosen. Whatever command is done, it is run on the compute node PDC: the user is actually on a computer node if the correct menu option is chosen. Whatever command is done, it is run on the compute node Start an interactive session \u00b6 To start an interactive session, one needs to allocate resources on the cluster first. The command to request an interactive node differs per HPC cluster: Cluster interactive salloc GfxLauncher Open OnDemand HPC2N Works Recommended N/A Recommended UPPMAX Recommended Works N/A N/A LUNARC Works N/A Recommended N/A NSC Recommended N/A N/A N/A PDC N/A Recommended Possible N/A Example, HPC2N vs. UPPMAX (also valid for NSC, PDC and LUNARC): graph TD subgraph uppmax[UPPMAX] subgraph login_node[Login nodes] user_on_login_node[User on login node] end subgraph compute_node[Compute nodes] user_on_computer_node[User on compute node] job_on_compute_node[Job on compute node] end end subgraph hpc2n[HPC2N] subgraph hpc2n_login_node[Login nodes] hpc2n_user_on_login_node[User on login node] hpc2n_user_in_interactive_mode[User on login node in interactive session] end subgraph hpc2n_compute_node[Compute nodes] hpcn2_job_on_compute_node[Job on compute node] end end user_on_login_node --> |interactive| user_on_computer_node user_on_login_node --> |sbatch| job_on_compute_node user_on_computer_node --> |exit| user_on_login_node user_on_computer_node --> |srun| user_on_computer_node hpc2n_user_on_login_node --> |salloc| hpc2n_user_in_interactive_mode hpc2n_user_in_interactive_mode --> |exit| hpc2n_user_on_login_node hpc2n_user_on_login_node --> |sbatch| hpcn2_job_on_compute_node hpc2n_user_in_interactive_mode --> |srun| hpcn2_job_on_compute_node First, you make a request for resources with interactive / salloc , like this: Interactive jobs Short serial example for running on different clusters. NSC PDC UPPMAX LUNARC HPC2N $ interactive -n <tasks> --time = HHH:MM:SS -A naiss2025-22-934 $ salloc -n <ntasks> --time = HHH:MM:SS -A naiss2025-22-934 -p <partition> Where is shared , main or gpu We recommend shared Wait until you get the node ssh to the node given and then work there Example: $ ssh nid001057 $ interactive -n <tasks> --time = HHH:MM:SS -A uppmax2025-2-360 $ interactive -n <tasks> --time = HHH:MM:SS -A lu2025-2-94 $ salloc -n <tasks> --time = HHH:MM:SS -A hpc2n2025-151 where is the number of tasks (or cores, for default 1 task per core), time is given in hours, minutes, and seconds (maximum T168 hours), and then you give the id for your project. Then, when you get the allocation, one can run programs in parallel by: srun -n <ntasks> ./program Your request enters the job queue just like any other job, and interactive/salloc will tell you that it is waiting for the requested resources. When salloc tells you that your job has been allocated resources, you can interactively run programs on those resources with srun . The commands you run with srun will then be executed on the resources your job has been allocated. On HPC2N If you do not preface with srun the command is run on the login node! You can now run Julia scripts on the allocated resources directly instead of waiting for your batch job to return a result. This is an advantage if you want to test your Julia script or perhaps figure out which parameters are best. End an interactive session \u00b6 When you have finished using the allocation, either wait for it to end, or close it with exit $ exit logout Documentation at the centers Interactive allocation on PDC Interactive allocation on NSC Interactive allocation on UPPMAX Interactive allocation on HPC2N Interactive allocation on LUNARC Exercise interactive session \u00b6 Run from ThinLinc (web or client!)

Then, when you get the allocation, one can run programs in parallel by: srun -n <ntasks> ./program Your request enters the job queue just like any other job, and interactive/salloc will tell you that it is waiting for the requested resources. When salloc tells you that your job has been allocated resources, you can interactively run programs on those resources with srun . The commands you run with srun will then be executed on the resources your job has been allocated. On HPC2N If you do not preface with srun the command is run on the login node! You can now run Julia scripts on the allocated resources directly instead of waiting for your batch job to return a result.

Check for Julia versions \u00b6 Long-term support versions So far Julia has Long-term support (LTS) for 1.6.7 1.10.X (high X is better) It might good to try to stick with such a version for future compatibility and support. Principle \u00b6 For some clusters module avail julia Example output From Tetralith: $ module avail julia ---------------------------------- /software/sse2/tetralith_el9/modules ----------------------------------- julia/recommendation (D) julia/1.6.1-nsc1-bdist julia/1.9.4-bdist julia/1.1.0-nsc1-gcc-2018a-eb julia/1.7.2-nsc1-bdist julia/1.10.2-bdist julia/1.4.1 julia/1.8.5-nsc1-bdist Where: D: Default Module Use \"module spider\" to find all possible modules and extensions. Use \"module keyword key1 key2 ...\" to search for all possible modules matching any of the \"keys\". Or, at clusters that hides the modules until relevant dependencies are loaded (HPC2N & PDC) module spider julia Example output From Dardel: $ module spider julia ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- julia: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Description: Julia is a high-level general-purpose dynamic programming language that was originally designed to address the needs of high-performance numerical analysis and computational science, without the typical need of separate compilation to be fast, also usable for client and server web use, low-level systems programming or as a specification language (wikipedia.org). Julia provides ease and expressiveness for high-level numerical computing, in the same way as languages such as R, MATLAB, and Python, but also supports general programming. To achieve this, Julia builds upon the lineage of mathematical programming languages, but also borrows much from popular dynamic languages, including Lisp, Perl, Python, Lua, and Ruby (julialang.org). Versions: julia/1.8.2-cpeGNU-22.06 julia/1.9.3-cpeGNU-22.06 julia/1.9.3-cpeGNU-23.03 julia/1.10.2-cpeGNU-23.03 julia/1.10.2-cpeGNU-23.12 Other possible modules matches: Julia libuv-julia ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- To find other possible module matches execute: $ module -r spider '.*julia.*' ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For detailed information about a specific \"julia\" package (including how to load the modules) use the module's full name. Note that names that have a trailing (E) are extensions provided by other modules. For example: $ module spider julia/1.10.2-cpeGNU-23.12 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Load a Julia module \u00b6 For reproducibility, we recommend ALWAYS loading a specific module for the Julia version instead of using the default one. Principle \u00b6 Use the output of existing module above! Load the module! At some clusters: module load julia/1.8.5 or at cluster that includes \u201carchitecture\u201d or \u201cbuild name\u201d in module name: ml julia/1.10.2-bdist Some clusters will require other modules to be loaded (Kebnekaise and Dardel) First check how to load (see Check for Julia versions above) $ module spider julia/1.10.2-cpeGNU-23.12 ... You will need to load all module(s) on any one of the lines below before the \"julia/1.10.2-cpeGNU-23.12\" module is available to load. PDC/23.12 Load PDC/23.12 first and then the julia module ml PDC/23.12 julia/1.10.2-cpeGNU-23.12 Run \u00b6 Run Julia as a session \u00b6 After loading the appropriate modules for Julia, you will have access to the read-eval-print-loop (REPL) command line by typing julia : julia In julia REPL Example This is what loading the Julia REPL looks like on Pelle: [username@pelle1 ~]$ ml No modules loaded [username@pelle1 ~]$ ml Julia/1.10.9 [username@pelle1 ~]$ ml Currently Loaded Modules: 1) Julia/1.10.9-LTS-linux-x86_64 [username@pelle1 ~]$ julia _ _ _ _(_)_ | Documentation: https://docs.julialang.org (_) | (_) (_) | _ _ _| |_ __ _ | Type \"?\" for help, \"]?\" for Pkg help. | | | | | | |/ _` | | | | |_| | | | (_| | | Version 1.10.9 (2025-03-10) _/ |\\__'_|_|_|\\__'_| | Official https://julialang.org/ release |__/ | julia> Modes: Julian mode \u00b6 Julia has different modes, the one we arrive at is the so-called Julian mode, where one can execute commands. The description for accessing these modes will be given in the following paragraphs. Once you are done with your work in any of the modes, you can return to the Julian mode by pressing the backspace key. Shell mode \u00b6 While being on the Julian mode you can enter the shell mode by typing ; : julia>; shell>pwd /current-folder-path this will allow you to use Linux commands. Notice that the availability of these commands depend on the OS, for instance, on Windows it will depend on the terminal that you have installed and if it is visible to the Julia installation. Package manager mode \u00b6 Another mode available in Julia is the package manager mode, it can be accessed by typing ] in the Julian mode: julia>] (v1.8) pkg> this will make your interaction with the package manager Pkg easier, for instance, instead of typing the complete name of Pkg commands such as Pkg.status() in the Julian mode, you can just type status in the package mode. Help mode \u00b6 The last mode is the help mode, you can enter this mode from the Julian one by typing ? , then you may type some string from which you need more information: julia >? help ?> ans search : ans transpose transcode contains expanduser instances MathConstants readlines LinearIndices leading_ones leading_zeros ans A variable referring to the last computed value , automatically set at the interactive prompt . Exiting \u00b6 Exit with julia> <Ctrl-D> or julia> exit() The Julian modes summary enter the shell mode by typing ; go back to Julian mode by <backspace> access the package manager mode by typing ] in the Julian mode use the help mode by typing ? in the Julian mode See also More detailed information about the modes in Julia can be found . Run a Julia script \u00b6 You can run a Julia script on the Linux shell as follows: $ julia example.jl where the script is a text file could contain these lines: println ( \"hello world\" ) Exercises \u00b6 Challenge 1a. Find out which versions are on your cluster from documentation Find/search for that documentation! Solutions UPPMAX HPC2N LUNARC NSC PDC Challenge 1b.

Objectives Understand and use the Slurm scheduler in MATLAB Start batch jobs from MATLAB Graphical User Interface (GUI) Try example MATLAB is well integrated with SLURM and because of that there are several options to run these jobs: Writing a batch script as for any other software and submitting the job with the sbatch command from SLURM (This could be useful if you want to run long jobs, and you don\u2019t need to modify the code in the meantime). You have seen this in the previous section. Using the job scheduler ( batch command) in MATLAB graphical user interface (GUI) (This is the Recommended Use). Starting a parpool in the MATLAB GUI with a predefined cluster (This allows for more interactivity). In the following sections we will extend the last two options. Important Compute allocations in this workshop Rackham: uppmax2025-2-360 Kebnekaise: hpc2n2025-062 Cosmos: lu2025-7-37 Tetralith: naiss-2025-22-262 Dardel: naiss-2025-22-262 Storage space for this workshop Rackham: /proj/r-py-jl-m-rackham Kebnekaise: /proj/nobackup/r-py-jl-m Cosmos: your home directory should have plenty of space Tetralith: /proj/r-matlab-julia-naiss/users/ Dardel: /cfs/klemming/projects/snic/r-matlab-julia-naiss Warning Any longer, resource-intensive, or parallel jobs must be run through a batch script . On login nodes, MATLAB should be started with the option -singleCompThread to stop it from using more than one thread (a couple of the clusters detect if the user is on a login node and restrict MATLAB to 1 thread automatically, but it\u2019s better to include it to be safe than forget and have your job killed by angry admins). On some clusters (e.g. COSMOS, Kebnekaise, Dardel), it is possible, and therefore recommended, to start the MATLAB GUI itself on a compute node. MATLAB Desktop/graphical interface \u00b6 Jobs can be submitted to the SLURM queue directly from the the MATLAB GUI as an alternative to the standard bash scripts that are used with the command sbatch my-script.sh , for instance. MATLAB GUI To submit a job from the GUI, you will need to create a handle for the cluster and then use this handle to send the job and control the outputs: % Get a handle to the cluster c = parcluster ( 'name-of-your-cluster' ) % Run the job on CPU j = c . batch (@ myfunction , N_out_values , { input1 , input2 , ... }, 'pool', N_workers') % alternatively, j=batch(c, @myfunction, N_out_values, {input1, input2, ...}, 'pool', N_workers') % Wait until the job has finished. Use j.State if you just want to poll the % status and be able to do other things while waiting for the job to finish. j . wait % Fetch the result after the job has finished j . fetchOutputs {:} Note that batch also accepts script names in place of function names, but these must be given in single quotes, with no @ or .m . This is useful if your script is a job farm. In the earlier session on using MATLAB with Slurm at the command line , you learned how to set/edit slurm parameters for jobs on a given cluster, after defining a handle for the cluster, by calling the AdditionalProperties attribute. Below we will discuss an alternative way to do that graphically. Job settings in the Cluster Profile Manager \u00b6 Tip You can change the job settings (or make them all together) inside the GUI. To do that, you change the job settings within the Cluster Profile Manager. Note that this is ONLY if you want to use the GUI. You can work completely from within the MATLAB terminal interface if you want. If you run MATLAB in the GUI after having configured the cluster, MATLAB will start with a default cluster profile, typically something that includes the name of the cluster. This is just the set of configurations that were set by configCluster . You can view, edit, and/or add to this profile by clicking the Parallel menu icon and selecting Create and Manage Clusters . Location of Parallel Menu in GUI. Cluster Profile Manager. If you scroll down in the window that appears when you select the right cluster, you will see a box titled Scheduler Plugin . This box lets you set SBATCH parameters like Your account name (project name), Your email address, The memory per CPU, including units, The number of processes per node, Which partition you want, Whether you need an exclusive node, The name of your reservation, and most importantly, The wall time for your job. Editing parameters of Scheduler Plugin in Cluster Profile Manager. In other words, almost anything you might otherwise set by calling c.AdditionalProperties.<insert_property>=... can be set in the GUI in this scheduler plugin. Note The settings in the Scheduler Plugin for any given cluster profile are saved between sessions. Always check them before running. If you are on Desktop On Demand on LUNARC, these settings do not override the parameters set in the GfxLauncher for the MATLAB GUI session itself, but rather to any batch jobs you submit from within the GUI. MATLAB and SLURM \u00b6 Extensive jobs must be run through SLURM. There are different manners to run MATLAB jobs with SLURM, for instance using: using the MATLAB GUI ThinLinc (LUNARC, UPPMAX, HPC2N) interactive ( salloc / interactive ) sessions Desktop On Demand (LUNARC) Open onDemand (HPC2N). batch scripts in a SSH session submitted with sbatch (less recommended) Serial jobs \u00b6 As an example consider the following serial function hostnm that is in a file called hostnm.m which gets the name of the host machine as an output: function hn = hostnm () hn = getenv ( 'HOSTNAME' ); end We can send a job to the queue which executes this function and retrieving/printing out the results as follows: c = parcluster ( 'name-of-your-cluster' ); j = c . batch (@ hostnm , 1 ,{}, 'pool' , 1 ); j . wait ; t = j . fetchOutputs {:}; fprintf ( 'Name of host: %s \\n' , t ); Parallel jobs \u00b6 Jobs can be parallelized in MATLAB using functionalities such as parfor , spmd , and parfeval . parfor \u00b6 This function will assist you if you want to parallelize a for loop . Although it will be performant, it imposes some constraints on the loops: The number of iterations must be well-defined, There can be no control over the individual workers, and There must be no data dependencies between the iterations. In the following example the name of the host machine will be printed n number of times and this number will be divided across the available number of workers: parfor i = 1 : 4 disp ( getenv ( \"HOSTNAME\" )) end spmd \u00b6 Single program multiple data (SPMD) is supported in MATLAB through the spmd functionality, here you enclose the code that will be executed by some workers independently. The workers are labeled with the variable labindex that can be used to control the workload of each worker. In the following example the name of the host will be displayed as many times as the present number of workers: spmd A = labindex ; % label for each worker disp ( getenv ( \"HOSTNAME\" )) % display the name of the host end parfeval \u00b6 This function is more advanced than the previous two and it allows you to do asynchronous calculations, which means that those calculations can start when resources are available but the execution order is not needed. The results can be fetched once the simulation finishes. f = parfeval (@ myFunction , 'nr. of outputs' , 'list of input arguments' ); results = fetchOutputs ( f ); Running parallel jobs \u00b6 Parallel jobs which include functions like parfor , spmd , and parfeval can be handled in two ways in the MATLAB GUI, either by using the batch command (we mentioned above for serial jobs) or by creating a parpool . Using batch \u00b6 It is recommended that you enclose the parallel code into a function and place it into a MATLAB script. In the parfor example mentioned above, we can write a script called hostnmp.m containing this code: function hn_all = hostnmp ( n ) hn_all = []; parfor i = 1 : n hn = ( getenv ( 'HOSTNAME' )); hn_all = [ hn_all , hn ]; % This array stores the host names for each worker end end Then, in the MATLAB GUI I can execute this function and retrieve/print out the results as follows: c = parcluster ( 'name-of-your-cluster' ); j = c . batch (@ hostnmp , 'nr. outputs' ,{ 'list of input args' }, 'pool' , 'nr. workers' ); j . wait ; % wait for the results t = j . fetchOutputs {:}; % fetch the results fprintf ( 'Name of host: %s \\n' , t ); % Print out the results Notice that if you will use this sequence of commands to launch many jobs, it will be convenient to write a MATLAB script so that next time you have these commands at hand. Creating a parpool \u00b6 This option is especially useful if you are working in an Open onDemand session because you are already working on the computing node. If you are doing continuous modifications to your code and running it to make sure that it works, using a parpool could be a better option than the batch command. Here, you create a pool of workers with the parpool function that are available to run parallel functions such as those mentioned above ( parfor , spmd , and parfeval ) until this pool is deleted. Warning Notice that if you run a serial function (that maybe consumes 100% of the CPU) inside a parpool block, this function will be executed on the local machine (maybe the login node) and not on a compute node. In the following example a pool of n workers is created that will solve a parfor loop which will display the host name: % Use parallel pool with 'parfor' parpool ( 'name-of-your-cluster' , n ); % Start parallel pool with nworkers = n workers p = gcp ; parfor i = 1 : n disp ( getenv ( \"HOSTNAME\" )) end % Clean up the parallel pool delete ( gcp ( 'nocreate' )); Notice that the host name displayed is the one where the job ran not where the MATLAB GUI is running. All parallel functionalities in MATLAB can be executed inside a parpool . If you are running the MATLAB GUI in an Open onDemand session you can use Processes as the name-of-your-cluster , as this cluster profile is used for running jobs locally. Exercises \u00b6 Challenge 1. Create and run a parallel code We have the following code in MATLAB that generates an array of 10000 random numbers and then the sum of all elements is stored in a variable called s : r = rand ( 1 , 10000 ); s = sum ( r ); We want now to repeat these steps (generating the numbers and taking the sum) 6 times so that the steps are run at the same time. Use parfor to parallelize these steps. Once your code is parallelized enclose it in a parpool section and send the job to the queue. Solution % Nr. of workers nworkers = 6 ; % Use parallel pool with 'parfor' parpool ( 'name-of-your-cluster' , nworkers ); % Start parallel pool with nworkers workers myarray = []; % Optional in this exercise to store partial results parfor i = 1 : nworkers r = rand ( 1 , 10000 ); s = sum ( r ); myarray = [ myarray , s ]; end myarray % print out the results from the workers % Clean up the parallel pool delete ( gcp ( 'nocreate' )); Challenge 2. Run a parallel code with batch MATLAB function The following function uses parfeval to do some computation (specifically it takes the average per-column of a matrix with a size nsize equal to 1000): function results = parfeval_mean ( nsize ) results = parfeval (@ mean , 1 , rand ( nsize )) end Place this function in a file called parfeval_mean.m and submit this function with the MATLAB batch command. Solution c = parcluster ( 'name-of-your-cluster' ); j = c . batch (@ parfeval_mean , 1 ,{ 1000 }, 'pool' , 1 ); j . wait ; % wait for the results t = j . fetchOutputs {:}; % fetch the results fprintf ( 'Name of host: %.5f \\n' , t ); % Print out the results Summary The SLURM scheduler handles allocations to the calculation nodes MATLAB has good integration with SLURM and because of that one can submit jobs to the queue directly from the GUI. MATLAB has several tools to parallelize your code and we have explored here parfor , spmd , and parfeval , but there are other tools available .","title":"MATLAB GUI and batch jobs"},{"location":"matlab/MatlabGUIslurm/#matlab-gui-and-slurm","text":"Here we discuss how MATLAB interacts with SLURM. Objectives Understand and use the Slurm scheduler in MATLAB Start batch jobs from MATLAB Graphical User Interface (GUI) Try example MATLAB is well integrated with SLURM and because of that there are several options to run these jobs: Writing a batch script as for any other software and submitting the job with the sbatch command from SLURM (This could be useful if you want to run long jobs, and you don\u2019t need to modify the code in the meantime).

On login nodes, MATLAB should be started with the option -singleCompThread to stop it from using more than one thread (a couple of the clusters detect if the user is on a login node and restrict MATLAB to 1 thread automatically, but it\u2019s better to include it to be safe than forget and have your job killed by angry admins).

If you run MATLAB in the GUI after having configured the cluster, MATLAB will start with a default cluster profile, typically something that includes the name of the cluster. This is just the set of configurations that were set by configCluster . You can view, edit, and/or add to this profile by clicking the Parallel menu icon and selecting Create and Manage Clusters .

But this should only be done for shorter jobs or jobs that do not use a lot of resources, as the login nodes can otherwise become slow for all users.

Interactive sessions at NSC, PDC, HPC2N, UPPMAX and LUNARC \u00b6 Here we define an interactive session as a session with direct access to a compute node. Or alternatively: an interactive session is a session, in which there is no queue before a command is run on a compute node.

Developed by MathWorks, MATLAB allows matrix manipulation, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs in other languages. Although it is numeric only, an optional toolbox uses the MuPAD symbolic engine, allowing access to computer algebra capabilities. Features of MATLAB \u00b6 Distinguishing pros of MATLAB include: A \u201clow-code\u201d interactive development environment (IDE) in which many common data import methods, analysis techniques, plotting formats, and even AI/ML techniques can be run from menus and generate the code required to reproduce the results automatically A rich library of Toolboxes and Add-Ons for different STEM disciplines, especially for modeling and simulations, all written and tested by professionals The ability to set cluster configurations and parallelisation settings graphically, and save them to profiles that can be reloaded at a click. Automatic multi-threading (note: this can also be a drawback) Full documentation available straight from the command line (requires internet) MATLAB also has some drawbacks: It is proprietary software, so you need a license and to sign up for an account (students and faculty at universities typically get these through the university). Many Add-Ons require a separate license. With respect to the 2-language problem (where one can optimise for either performance or ease of prototyping, but not both), MATLAB even moreso than Python is geared toward usability. It can be slow. The way MATLAB automates multithreading means it will typically hog a full node unless you explicitly tell it not to by setting -singleCompThread as an option at startup, or unless your local cluster is configured to automatically limit the number of processes started on a login node. Built-in plotting functions generate very low-resolution raster graphics with poor anti-aliasing in the GUI, and what the GUI shows is not necessarily how the saved image will appear. Making publication-ready plots requires extensive tuning of graphics parameters and repeated exports to special file formats to check your work.

ThinLinc access is restricted to 30 users for the whole Dardel cluster. Most HPC centres in Sweden use the same or a similar module system for their software. The difference lies in which modules are installed and their versions/naming. The general examples below will be similar for all HPC centres in Sweden, with some variation in naming and available versions. Short cheat sheet See which modules exists: module spider or ml spider Find module versions for a particular software: module spider <software> Modules depending only on what is currently loaded: module avail or ml av See which modules are currently loaded: module list or ml Load a module: module load <module>/<version> or ml <module>/<version> Unload a module: module unload <module>/<version> or ml -<module>/<version> More information about a module: module show <module>/<version> or ml show <module>/<version> Unload all modules except the \u201csticky\u201d modules: module purge or ml purge Save currently loaded modules: module save <collection_name> (especially useful on Dardel) (Re)load modules from saved collection: module restore <collection_name> Caution Note that the module systems at UPPMAX, HPC2N, LUNARC, NSC, and PDC are slightly different. There is no system MATLAB that comes preloaded like Python at any of these HPC resources, but ml load matlab with no release date will load the latest release, which is periodically updated. For reproducibility reasons, you should be sure to load the same release throughout a given project. While all modules at UPPMAX and NSC not directly related to bio-informatics are shown by ml avail , modules at the other centers may be hidden until one has loaded a prerequisite, like the compiler GCC . You need to use module spider to see all modules at HPC2N, LUNARC, and PDC, and ml avail for those available to load given your currently loaded prerequisites. New sessions on Dardel (PDC) start with 13 modules loaded, but only one of them is sticky (i.e. will remain loaded after a ml purge command). We highly recommended that you save the preloaded modules as a collection so that you can quickly restore the default modules if you accidentally use ml purge instead of ml unload <module> . Check for MATLAB versions \u00b6 Type-Along \u00b6 Below we have examples for how to check for MATLAB versions on different clusters. Follow along at your cluster. UPPMAX (Rackham and Pelle) and NSC (Tetralith) HPC2N LUNARC PDC (Dardel) Check all available MATLAB versions with: module avail matlab Output on Rackham as of 22 September 2025: ---------------------------- /sw/mf/rackham/applications ---------------------------- matlab/R2014a matlab/R2018a matlab/R2022b matlab/7.10 matlab/R2015a matlab/R2018b matlab/R2023a matlab/7.13 matlab/R2015b matlab/R2019a matlab/R2023b ( D ) matlab/8.0 matlab/R2016a matlab/R2020b matlab/7.4 matlab/8.1 matlab/R2017a matlab/R2022a matlab/7.8 Where: D: Default Module Output on Pelle as of 22 September 2025: ---------------------------- /sw/mf/pelle/applications ---------------------------- MATLAB/2023b-update4 MATLAB/2024a Where: D: Default Module Output on Tetralith as of 27 Feb 2025: --------------------- /software/sse2/tetralith_el9/modules --------------------- MATLAB/recommendation ( D ) MATLAB/2023b-bdist MATLAB/2023a-bdist MATLAB/2024a-hpc1-bdist Where: D: Default Module Check all available MATLAB versions with: module spider MATLAB As of 26 Sep 2024, the above outputs the following on Kebnekaise: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- MATLAB: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Description: MATLAB is a high-level language and interactive environment that enables you to perform computationally intensive tasks faster than with traditional programming languages such as C, C++, and Fortran. Versions: MATLAB/2019b.Update2 MATLAB/2021a MATLAB/2021b MATLAB/2022b.Update3 MATLAB/2023a.Update4 Other possible modules matches: MATLAB-parallel-support ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Note that it is case-sensitive and must be in ALL-CAPS. There will be results if you type matlab , but they won\u2019t be the ones you want. To see how to load a specific version of MATLAB, including the prerequisites, do module spider MATLAB/<version> Example for MATLAB 2023a.Update4 module spider MATLAB/2023a.Update4 See all available MATLAB versions at the command line with: ml spider matlab Or, if on Desktop On-Demand, select Applications in the top left corner and hover over Applications - Matlab (see also GUI section below).

Note that names that have a trailing ( E ) are extensions provided by other modules. For example: module spider matlab/2023b ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- See all available MATLAB versions at the command line with: ml spider matlab As of 17 Mar 2025, the above command outputs the following on Dardel: Versions: matlab/r2020b matlab/r2021b matlab/r2022b matlab/r2023a matlab/r2024a-ps matlab/r2024a matlab/r2024b On Dardel, all MATLAB versions have a prerequisite that needs to be loaded (it will called something like PDC/xx.xx or PDCOLD/xx.xx). To view the prerequisites for a specific version of MATLAB, do module spider matlab/<version> For example, module spider matlab/r2024b outputs the following: matlab: matlab/r2024b You will need to load all module ( s ) on any one of the lines below before the \"matlab/r2024b\" module is available to load. PDC/23.12 Help: For more information, visit: https://www.mathworks.com Load a MATLAB module \u00b6 For reproducibility, we recommend ALWAYS loading a specific module instead of using the default version! For this course, we recommend using MATLAB R2023x at UPPMAX (R2023b), NSC (2023b), and HPC2N (2023b), or R2024b at LUNARC (2024b). At PDC, we recommend r2024b. Type-along \u00b6 Try loading a MATLAB module at the command line. First, go back and check which MATLAB modules were available. UPPMAX HPC2N (Kebnekaise) LUNARC (COSMOS) NSC (Tetralith) PDC (Dardel) Rackham. To load version 2023b, do: module load matlab/R2023b Note: all lowercase except the R. For short, you can also use ml instead of module load Pelle. To load version 2023b-update4, do: module load MATLAB/2023b-update4 Note: MATLAB is all uppercase. For short, you can also use ml instead of module load To load version 2023b, do: module load MATLAB/2023b Note: all Uppercase except for the letter after the year. For short, you can also use: ml MATLAB/2023b To load version 2024b, do: module load matlab/2024b Note: all lowercase. For short, you can also use: ml matlab/2024b To load version 2023b, do: module load MATLAB/2023b-bdist Note: all Uppercase except for the letter after the year. For short, you can also use: ml MATLAB/2023b If you check with ml which version is loaded, you will see the -bdist suffix was added automatically. Versions without -bdist at the end only appear with ml spider matlab and they do not appear to be loadable. Go back and check which MATLAB modules were available, and what their prerequisites are. To load version 2024b, do: module load PDC/23.12 module load matlab/r2024b Notes: the module name is all lowercase including the r before the year. For short, you can also use: ml PDC/23.12 matlab/r2024b Start MATLAB at the Command Line \u00b6 Most of the time, you will run either MATLAB live scripts ( .mlx ) or basic script or function files ( .m ). Live scripts can only be opened and worked on in the GUI, while basic function or script files can also be run from a batch script and/or at the command line. Note At the command line, function definition is typically not supported unless the function is short and anonymous. User-defined functions must generally be written up and saved to separate .m files. The GUI is often the recommended interface where it is offered. SLURM jobs can be set up through the Parallel Computing Toolbox , which will be discussed later. The resources required to run the GUI and those required to run a job submitted to SLURM are separate, so do not worry if the maximum allocation time for a MATLAB GUI session is much less than the limit for a SLURM job. -singleCompThread When starting MATLAB from the command line, the -singleCompThread flag is usually required to prevent MATLAB from spawning as many processes as it thinks it needs up to the full capacity of a node. At most HPC centers, terminal instances launch MATLAB (either the GUI or command line) on a login node by default. Hogging a login node can disrupt jobs and access for other users, and violates the NAISS user agreement. HPC center staff reserve the right to kill disruptive tasks without warning. A few HPC centers detect if you have started on a login node and set maxCompThreads to 1 automatically, but when in doubt, use -singleCompThread to be safe. Setting -singleCompThread does not prevent MATLAB from sending parallelised and/or multi-threaded jobs to SLURM or the MATLAB Distributed Computing Server (MDCS). Type-along \u00b6 Try starting MATLAB at the command line. We will use the same versions as in the previous section. UPPMAX (Rackham and Pelle?) and NSC (Tetralith) HPC2N (Kebnekaise) LUNARC (COSMOS) PDC (Dardel) Once you\u2019ve loaded your preferred version of MATLAB, type: matlab -nodisplay to start MATLAB in the terminal. The maximum number of computational threads will be set to 1 automatically if you are on a log-in node. The GUI can be started in a ThinLinc session by going to \u201cApplication\u201d \u2192 \u201cHPC2N Applications\u201d \u2192 \u201cApplications\u201d \u2192 \u201cMatlab \u201d and clicking the desired version. To start MATLAB in the terminal, load matlab/2023b or your preferred version, and then type: matlab -singleCompThread -nodisplay to start MATLAB in the terminal. The -singleCompThread is important to prevent MATLAB from hogging a whole node, and the -nodisplay flag prevents the GUI from launching. It is recommended that GUI be started in ThinLinc at the LUNARC HPC Desktop On-Demand. To start MATLAB in the terminal, you must first choose the correct terminal. There are several in the Applications menu: three in Applications - General , which can safely launch either the MATLAB GUI or MATLAB command line on a compute node, one in Applications - Visualization , which should be reserved for very graphics-heavy jobs, and one in Favorites , which MATLAB users should avoid because it runs on a login node. Starting any of the ones under menu headings starting with Applications - will open a GfxLauncher popup that prompts you for your account and resource choices. Even users who have been awarded GPU time are encouraged to use the CPU-only terminal whenever possible, as they are abundant, less resource intensive, and allow longer wall times. Once you\u2019ve opened a terminal session and loaded your preferred version type: matlab -singleCompThread -nodisplay Starting a MATLAB session on Dardel looks different depending on whether or not you are affiliated KTH or have been added to the MATLAB user group by PDC support (e.g. as part of this course, if you signed up in time). If you are a KTH affiliate or another PDC-approved academic user, you are covered by KTH\u2019s university license. Otherwise, you will need to have a MathWorks account and be logged into it in your browser before getting started, because MATLAB on Dardel will ask you provide the email associated with your MathWorks account and a one-time password (OTP) sent to that account online (which you will have to copy from your browser). Either way, you will first need to load the corresponding PDC, PDCOLD, or PDCTEST prerequisite. The current default is PDC/23.12, and that makes available any MATLAB version from 2024. The only version that reliably works for non-KTH users without asking for credentials is r2024-ps. If you, for example, wanted to start matlab/r2024a-ps in the terminal, the sequence would look as follows: ml PDC/23.12 matlab/r2024a-ps matlab -singleCompThread -nosplash -nodesktop -nodisplay If you are an academic user who has been vetted by PDC staff, the above should be enough to eventually take you to the MATLAB command prompt. Otherwise, you will see the following: Please enter your MathWorks Account email address and press Enter: <your.email@your.institute.se> You need a one-time password to sign in . To get a one-time password, follow these steps: 1 . Go to https://www.mathworks.com/mwa/otp 2 . Enter your MathWorks Account email address. 3 . Copy the generated one-time password. 4 . Return here and enter the password. Enter the one-time password: If you are a student or staff member at KTH and you see these credential requests, that means PDC support did not receive your request for MATLAB access. !!! note PDC users may also go through ThinLinc and open MATLAB from the On-Demand Applications menu, but this is not recommended. Only 30 users are allowed to interface with Dardel via ThinLinc at any one time, and queue times are very long. Start the MATLAB GUI \u00b6 Running the MATLAB GUI requires that users be logged into a ThinLinc session. Refer to the login section for help. HPC2N (Kebnekaise) UPPMAX (Pelle) NSC (Tetralith) LUNARC (COSMOS) PDC (Dardel) For HPC2N, once logged into the remote desktop, the procedure for starting the MATLAB GUI is the same as what was shown above to start it at the command line, except that the -nodisplay flag is omitted (as are -nodesktop -nosplash if applicable). You should still include -singleCompThread ! It is possible to start the MATLAB GUI on a compute node on Kebnekaise (HPC2N). The procedure uses salloc and srun to achieve what other facilities often do with the interactive command (edit time, resources, project ID, and MATLAB version as needed): salloc -N 1 -t 00 :30:00 -A hpc2n20YY-XXX module load MATLAB/2023b srun matlab Finally, HPC2N also has MATLAB available through the Open OnDemand portal. We will cover this briefly in a later lecture , and there is more specific documentation in the HPC2N connection guides . For UPPMAX users, once logged into the remote desktop, the procedure for starting the MATLAB GUI is the same as what was shown above to start it at the command line, except that the -nodisplay flag is omitted (as are -nodesktop -nosplash if applicable). You should still include -singleCompThread ! It is also possible to start the MATLAB GUI on the login node. A MATLAB GUI session on a compute node can be run with the following commands (again, edit time, resources, project ID, and MATLAB version as needed): interactive -n 4 -t 00 :30:00 -A uppmax2025-2-360 module load MATLAB/2023b-update4 matlab In the above example, -n 4 means the job will run on 4 cores. Pelle nodes have 96 cores. Please refer to this link for allowed combinations of interactive parameters. The best way to start the MATLAB GUI on Tetralith depends on how intensively you plan to use the GUI. Most of the time, it is recommended to use the interactive command first to get an allocation on a compute node. The commands you will need to enter look like the following (change the MATLAB version and interactive job specifications as needed): interactive -N 1 --exclusive -t 4 :00:00 module load MATLAB/2024a-hpc1-bdist matlab -softwareopengl For short (<<1 hour) tasks requiring few resources, once you\u2019ve loaded your preferred version of MATLAB, you can use the following command to start MATLAB on a login node: vglrun matlab -nosoftwareopengl You do not need to include -singleCompThread because maxNumCompThreads will be set to 1 automatically to account for starting on a login node. The recommended way to open the MATLAB GUI on COSMOS is by using Desktop On-Demand . We will go over this in the first session after lunch. There are 3 versions per MATLAB release in the Apps menu\u2014regular, (CPU), and (HEP,CPU)\u2014and your resource choices partly depend on which of those you select. The (HEP,CPU) nodes are private. The regular versions may run on either AMD/NVIDIA A40 48-core nodes or Intel/NVIDIA A40 32-core nodes, and the maximum allowed wall times for each are 24 and 48 hours, respectively. If you do not plan to do any intensive graphical work inside the GUI, you can choose the (CPU) version of your preferred release to access an AMD A100 48-core node, which also allows you to run for up to 7 days (168:00:00). There are 2 ways to run MATLAB interactively on Dardel: via SSH with X-forwarding (recommended), or via Desktop On-Demand in a ThinLinc window. ThinLinc access to Dardel is limited to 30 users total, and even if you do get through, interactive jobs are likely to be stuck in queues for a long time. SSH with X-forwarding. When you first ssh into Dardel, you will need to have added the -X flag between ssh and your username. Once you are logged in, you need to book a compute node with salloc , and then SSH (again with the -X flag) into whichever node you are assigned to by salloc . The salloc step and its output will look something like this: salloc -N 1 -t 00 :30:00 -A naiss2025-22-262 -p main if you request a full node, or salloc -c 16 -t 00 :30:00 -A naiss2025-22-262 -p shared if you request, for example, 16 cores on a shared node. Adjust the time, resources, and account number as needed. salloc will then print a handful of lines about the progress of allocating and queuing your job. The last line of output, something like salloc: Nodes nid00xxxx are ready for job , will contain the ID of the node you booked. Copy that, and then run the following lines (after the :~> prompt; adjust the node ID as needed): <user>@login1:~> ssh -X nid001756 <user>@nid001756:~> ml PDC/23.12 <user>@nid001756:~> ml matlab/r2024a-ps <user>@nid001756:~> matlab The GUI will take a few minutes to load. If you are lucky enough to get into Dardel via ThinLinc, the process looks very similar to LUNARC because Dardel uses the same Desktop On-Demand interface, except that the MATLAB versions in the app menu are under PDC - Matlab and are not separated by the types of nodes to run on. Exercises \u00b6 Try them yourself! Note that $ indicates a bash prompt and >> indicates the MATLAB prompt; those characters should not be included at the front of your input. Challenge 1. Load MATLAB in the terminal or GUI. Then do a few simple commands at the command line. For example, $ ml matlab/2023b $ matlab -singleCompThread -nodisplay < M A T L A B ( R ) > Copyright 1984 -2023 The MathWorks, Inc.

Copy the example function below to a file called add2.m in your working directory or the MATLAB directory that the configuration step created for you in your Documents folder. Then run it at the MATLAB command line. function result = add2 ( x,y ) result = x + y disp ( \"The sum of \" + x + \" and \" + y + \" is \" + result ) end Solution >> add2 ( 5 , 8 ) result = 13 The sum of 5 and 8 is 13 >> Challenge 3. Exit the MATLAB command line. Use quit or exit (this can take a few seconds). Solution >> exit Summary You can start MATLAB either in a GUI or, with the -nodisplay flag, run it in the terminal. If you start either interface from the terminal, you must first load the correct module(s). For interactive work, you will usually have to reserve time on a compute node, but some facilities have a Desktop On-Demand interface that makes that easier. If you take the risk of starting on a login node, use the -singleCompThread flag in the starting command to avoid hogging the node, unless you are sure that your cluster sets that constraint on the login node automatically.","title":"Load and run"},{"location":"matlab/load_runMatlab/#load-and-run-matlab","text":"Objectives Load MATLAB Run MATLAB scripts Start the MATLAB graphical user interface (GUI) Important Different recommended procedures for each HPC center: UPPMAX, NSC, and HPC2N : use module system to load at command line LUNARC : recommended to use Desktop On-Demand menu, but interactive and non-interactive command lines available PDC : recommended to load at command line; can run interactively on a compute node with X-forwarding and salloc . ThinLinc access is restricted to 30 users for the whole Dardel cluster. Most HPC centres in Sweden use the same or a similar module system for their software.

There is no system MATLAB that comes preloaded like Python at any of these HPC resources, but ml load matlab with no release date will load the latest release, which is periodically updated. For reproducibility reasons, you should be sure to load the same release throughout a given project. While all modules at UPPMAX and NSC not directly related to bio-informatics are shown by ml avail , modules at the other centers may be hidden until one has loaded a prerequisite, like the compiler GCC . You need to use module spider to see all modules at HPC2N, LUNARC, and PDC, and ml avail for those available to load given your currently loaded prerequisites. New sessions on Dardel (PDC) start with 13 modules loaded, but only one of them is sticky (i.e. will remain loaded after a ml purge command).

Live scripts can only be opened and worked on in the GUI, while basic function or script files can also be run from a batch script and/or at the command line. Note At the command line, function definition is typically not supported unless the function is short and anonymous. User-defined functions must generally be written up and saved to separate .m files. The GUI is often the recommended interface where it is offered. SLURM jobs can be set up through the Parallel Computing Toolbox , which will be discussed later. The resources required to run the GUI and those required to run a job submitted to SLURM are separate, so do not worry if the maximum allocation time for a MATLAB GUI session is much less than the limit for a SLURM job. -singleCompThread When starting MATLAB from the command line, the -singleCompThread flag is usually required to prevent MATLAB from spawning as many processes as it thinks it needs up to the full capacity of a node. At most HPC centers, terminal instances launch MATLAB (either the GUI or command line) on a login node by default. Hogging a login node can disrupt jobs and access for other users, and violates the NAISS user agreement. HPC center staff reserve the right to kill disruptive tasks without warning. A few HPC centers detect if you have started on a login node and set maxCompThreads to 1 automatically, but when in doubt, use -singleCompThread to be safe. Setting -singleCompThread does not prevent MATLAB from sending parallelised and/or multi-threaded jobs to SLURM or the MATLAB Distributed Computing Server (MDCS).","title":"Start MATLAB at the Command Line"},{"location":"matlab/load_runMatlab/#type-along_2","text":"Try starting MATLAB at the command line. We will use the same versions as in the previous section. UPPMAX (Rackham and Pelle?) and NSC (Tetralith) HPC2N (Kebnekaise) LUNARC (COSMOS) PDC (Dardel) Once you\u2019ve loaded your preferred version of MATLAB, type: matlab -nodisplay to start MATLAB in the terminal. The maximum number of computational threads will be set to 1 automatically if you are on a log-in node. The GUI can be started in a ThinLinc session by going to \u201cApplication\u201d \u2192 \u201cHPC2N Applications\u201d \u2192 \u201cApplications\u201d \u2192 \u201cMatlab \u201d and clicking the desired version. To start MATLAB in the terminal, load matlab/2023b or your preferred version, and then type: matlab -singleCompThread -nodisplay to start MATLAB in the terminal. The -singleCompThread is important to prevent MATLAB from hogging a whole node, and the -nodisplay flag prevents the GUI from launching. It is recommended that GUI be started in ThinLinc at the LUNARC HPC Desktop On-Demand. To start MATLAB in the terminal, you must first choose the correct terminal. There are several in the Applications menu: three in Applications - General , which can safely launch either the MATLAB GUI or MATLAB command line on a compute node, one in Applications - Visualization , which should be reserved for very graphics-heavy jobs, and one in Favorites , which MATLAB users should avoid because it runs on a login node. Starting any of the ones under menu headings starting with Applications - will open a GfxLauncher popup that prompts you for your account and resource choices. Even users who have been awarded GPU time are encouraged to use the CPU-only terminal whenever possible, as they are abundant, less resource intensive, and allow longer wall times. Once you\u2019ve opened a terminal session and loaded your preferred version type: matlab -singleCompThread -nodisplay Starting a MATLAB session on Dardel looks different depending on whether or not you are affiliated KTH or have been added to the MATLAB user group by PDC support (e.g. as part of this course, if you signed up in time). If you are a KTH affiliate or another PDC-approved academic user, you are covered by KTH\u2019s university license. Otherwise, you will need to have a MathWorks account and be logged into it in your browser before getting started, because MATLAB on Dardel will ask you provide the email associated with your MathWorks account and a one-time password (OTP) sent to that account online (which you will have to copy from your browser). Either way, you will first need to load the corresponding PDC, PDCOLD, or PDCTEST prerequisite. The current default is PDC/23.12, and that makes available any MATLAB version from 2024. The only version that reliably works for non-KTH users without asking for credentials is r2024-ps. If you, for example, wanted to start matlab/r2024a-ps in the terminal, the sequence would look as follows: ml PDC/23.12 matlab/r2024a-ps matlab -singleCompThread -nosplash -nodesktop -nodisplay If you are an academic user who has been vetted by PDC staff, the above should be enough to eventually take you to the MATLAB command prompt. Otherwise, you will see the following: Please enter your MathWorks Account email address and press Enter: <your.email@your.institute.se> You need a one-time password to sign in . To get a one-time password, follow these steps: 1 . Go to https://www.mathworks.com/mwa/otp 2 . Enter your MathWorks Account email address. 3 . Copy the generated one-time password. 4 . Return here and enter the password. Enter the one-time password: If you are a student or staff member at KTH and you see these credential requests, that means PDC support did not receive your request for MATLAB access. !!! note PDC users may also go through ThinLinc and open MATLAB from the On-Demand Applications menu, but this is not recommended.

HPC2N (Kebnekaise) UPPMAX (Pelle) NSC (Tetralith) LUNARC (COSMOS) PDC (Dardel) For HPC2N, once logged into the remote desktop, the procedure for starting the MATLAB GUI is the same as what was shown above to start it at the command line, except that the -nodisplay flag is omitted (as are -nodesktop -nosplash if applicable). You should still include -singleCompThread ! It is possible to start the MATLAB GUI on a compute node on Kebnekaise (HPC2N). The procedure uses salloc and srun to achieve what other facilities often do with the interactive command (edit time, resources, project ID, and MATLAB version as needed): salloc -N 1 -t 00 :30:00 -A hpc2n20YY-XXX module load MATLAB/2023b srun matlab Finally, HPC2N also has MATLAB available through the Open OnDemand portal. We will cover this briefly in a later lecture , and there is more specific documentation in the HPC2N connection guides . For UPPMAX users, once logged into the remote desktop, the procedure for starting the MATLAB GUI is the same as what was shown above to start it at the command line, except that the -nodisplay flag is omitted (as are -nodesktop -nosplash if applicable). You should still include -singleCompThread ! It is also possible to start the MATLAB GUI on the login node. A MATLAB GUI session on a compute node can be run with the following commands (again, edit time, resources, project ID, and MATLAB version as needed): interactive -n 4 -t 00 :30:00 -A uppmax2025-2-360 module load MATLAB/2023b-update4 matlab In the above example, -n 4 means the job will run on 4 cores. Pelle nodes have 96 cores. Please refer to this link for allowed combinations of interactive parameters. The best way to start the MATLAB GUI on Tetralith depends on how intensively you plan to use the GUI. Most of the time, it is recommended to use the interactive command first to get an allocation on a compute node. The commands you will need to enter look like the following (change the MATLAB version and interactive job specifications as needed): interactive -N 1 --exclusive -t 4 :00:00 module load MATLAB/2024a-hpc1-bdist matlab -softwareopengl For short (<<1 hour) tasks requiring few resources, once you\u2019ve loaded your preferred version of MATLAB, you can use the following command to start MATLAB on a login node: vglrun matlab -nosoftwareopengl You do not need to include -singleCompThread because maxNumCompThreads will be set to 1 automatically to account for starting on a login node. The recommended way to open the MATLAB GUI on COSMOS is by using Desktop On-Demand . We will go over this in the first session after lunch. There are 3 versions per MATLAB release in the Apps menu\u2014regular, (CPU), and (HEP,CPU)\u2014and your resource choices partly depend on which of those you select. The (HEP,CPU) nodes are private. The regular versions may run on either AMD/NVIDIA A40 48-core nodes or Intel/NVIDIA A40 32-core nodes, and the maximum allowed wall times for each are 24 and 48 hours, respectively. If you do not plan to do any intensive graphical work inside the GUI, you can choose the (CPU) version of your preferred release to access an AMD A100 48-core node, which also allows you to run for up to 7 days (168:00:00). There are 2 ways to run MATLAB interactively on Dardel: via SSH with X-forwarding (recommended), or via Desktop On-Demand in a ThinLinc window. ThinLinc access to Dardel is limited to 30 users total, and even if you do get through, interactive jobs are likely to be stuck in queues for a long time. SSH with X-forwarding. When you first ssh into Dardel, you will need to have added the -X flag between ssh and your username. Once you are logged in, you need to book a compute node with salloc , and then SSH (again with the -X flag) into whichever node you are assigned to by salloc . The salloc step and its output will look something like this: salloc -N 1 -t 00 :30:00 -A naiss2025-22-262 -p main if you request a full node, or salloc -c 16 -t 00 :30:00 -A naiss2025-22-262 -p shared if you request, for example, 16 cores on a shared node. Adjust the time, resources, and account number as needed. salloc will then print a handful of lines about the progress of allocating and queuing your job. The last line of output, something like salloc: Nodes nid00xxxx are ready for job , will contain the ID of the node you booked. Copy that, and then run the following lines (after the :~> prompt; adjust the node ID as needed): <user>@login1:~> ssh -X nid001756 <user>@nid001756:~> ml PDC/23.12 <user>@nid001756:~> ml matlab/r2024a-ps <user>@nid001756:~> matlab The GUI will take a few minutes to load. If you are lucky enough to get into Dardel via ThinLinc, the process looks very similar to LUNARC because Dardel uses the same Desktop On-Demand interface, except that the MATLAB versions in the app menu are under PDC - Matlab and are not separated by the types of nodes to run on.","title":"Start the MATLAB GUI"},{"location":"matlab/load_runMatlab/#exercises","text":"Try them yourself!

The batch system used at UPPMAX, HPC2N, LUNARC, NSC, and PDC is called SLURM. The same is the case at most of the Swedish HPC centres. SLURM is an Open Source job scheduler, which provides three key functions: - Keeps track of available system resources - Enforces local system resource usage and job scheduling policies - Manages a job queue, distributing work across resources according to policies Users ask for compute resources via the sbatch command (as those who attended yesterday\u2019s R session will already know). To run a batch job, you must create and submit a SLURM submit file (also called a batch submit file, a batch script, or a job script). Guides and documentation at: https://docs.hpc2n.umu.se/documentation/batchsystem/intro/ https://docs.uppmax.uu.se/cluster_guides/slurm/ https://lunarc-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/submitting_jobs/manual_basic_job/ https://www.nsc.liu.se/support/batch-jobs/introduction/ https://support.pdc.kth.se/doc/run_jobs/job_scheduling/ https://www.c3se.chalmers.se/documentation/submitting_jobs/running_jobs/ MATLAB is well integrated with SLURM, so there are several ways to run these jobs: Using the job scheduler ( batch command) in MATLAB Desktop/graphical interface (This is the Recommended Use). Starting a parpool with a predefined cluster (This allows for more interactivity). Writing a batch script as for any other software and submitting the job with the sbatch command from SLURM (This could be particularly useful if you want to run long jobs and you don\u2019t need to modify the code in the meantime). In the following sections we will extend these concepts. Useful commands to the batch system \u00b6 Before going into MATLAB specifics for batch jobs, we should look briefly at some useful commands: Submit job: sbatch <jobscript.sh> Get list of your jobs: squeue --me Check on a specific job: scontrol show job <job-id> Delete a specific job: scancel <job-id> Useful info about a job: sacct -l -j <job-id> | less -S Url to a page with info about the job (Kebnekaise only): job-usage <job-id> First time configuration \u00b6 In order to be able to submit jobs to the SLURM queue, you usually need to configure MATLAB the first time you load any particular version. This configuration step will provide a set of default specifications for batch and parallel jobs called a cluster profile . Configuration only needs to be run once per version of MATLAB on each cluster. These specifications can be changed or added to at runtime, and it is possible to have more than one profile for a single release. The instructions for each facility are linked below: HPC2N: Configure MATLAB UPPMAX: MATLAB configuration LUNARC: Configuration at the command line NSC: MATLAB (scroll down to \u201cBefore submitting your first job\u201d) . PDC: no need to configure C3SE: no need to configure Warning On Dardel you need to either have your own Mathworks account, or contact them ahead of time and ask for access to run MATLAB there! Do NOT run configCluster(.sh) on Dardel! For most clusters, configuration can be done at the regular terminal using a shell script called configCluster.sh . At most clusters, it is possible to run configCluster (without \u201c.sh\u201d) on the MATLAB command line; for NSC, this is the only way to run the configuration program. The tabs below demonstrate the preferred method for each cluster where configuration is required the first time you use a given version of MATLAB.

Log in and Configure MATLAB. Log into your chosen HPC cluster if you have not already. Load the newest version of MATLAB (find with ml spider MATLAB ). Note that on Dardel it has a prerequisite which you must load first, and that only the matlab/r2024a-ps (prerequisite PDCOLD/23.12) allows access from the shell/terminal without you having to give your own Mathworks credentials. Depending on cluster, now do NSC: Run configCluster inside MATLAB on the terminal (start with matlab -singleCompThread -nodisplay -nosplash -nodesktop ). PDC: You do not do configCluster C3SE: You do not do configCluster HPC2N. Run configCluster.sh on the terminal UPPMAX: Run configCluster.sh <project-id> on the terminal LUNARC. Run ``configCluster.sh on the terminl MATLAB terminal interface \u00b6 Here we will discuss: Starting MATLAB on the command line Job settings c.parcluster c.AdditionalProperties. c.batch Starting a job from within MATLAB This section will show you how to use MATLAB completely from the shell/terminal without having to open the GUI. This can be useful if you only have a regular SSH connection or otherwise need to run something fast and lightweight instead of having to open the GUI. This is an extra advantage when you have a poor network connection. Starting MATLAB \u00b6 To start MATLAB on the command line, without running the GUI, load the MATLAB version and do matlab -singleCompThread -nodisplay -nosplash -nodesktop This starts MATLAB. Not all of the flags shown are needed at every center, but it does no harm to include them. Danger On the login-nodes MATLAB must be started with the option -singleCompThread to prevent MATLAB from starting an arbitrary number of threads, potentially occupying the whole node.

Job settings at the command line \u00b6 If you want to run a MATLAB program on the cluster with batch, you have to set some things for the job. Start MATLAB and input the following: NSC, HPC2N, LUNARC, UPPMAX >> c = parcluster ( 'CLUSTER' ); >> c . AdditionalProperties . AccountName = 'PROJECT-ID' ; >> c . AdditionalProperties . WallTime = 'HHH1:MM:SS' ; >> c . saveProfile To list the content of your profile, enter c.AdditionalProperties at the prompt. Important On UPPMAX and PDC you should use c=parcluster; instead of c=parcluster('CLUSTER') . On UPPMAX you also need to add c.AdditionalProperties.ProcsPerNode=20; . C3SE The parallel toolbox does not allow multi-node jobs. You should run an interactive job on a compute node, so do this first: srun --account = naiss2025-22-934 --gpus-per-node = T4:1 --time = 01 :00:00 --pty /bin/bash Now start Matlab on the compute node: matlab -singleCompThread -nodisplay -nosplash -nodesktop And do the example (we already set account and walltime when allocating the compute node): >> c = parcluster ( 'local' ); Additional instructions specific to Dardel The process at PDC (Dardel) is more involved than at other facilities: At PDC, you do NOT set any AdditionalProperties . You instead work in an interactive session. To start an interactive session at PDC \u2026 \u2026on a full node: use salloc -N 1 -t 00:30:00 -A naiss2025-22-934 -p main \u2026on a subset of the cores on a node (here 24): use salloc -c 24 -t 1:00:00 -A naiss2025-22-262 -p shared When the job is allocated, start an SSH connection to the compute node. If you need the GUI on Dardel, you need to start both the SSH connection to the Dardel login node and to the compute node with ssh -X (i.e. use ssh -X <node-allocated-to-you> ). Then, you can load MATLAB and start it (on shell) as usual with ml PDCOLD/23.12 matlab/r2024a-ps matlab -nodisplay -nodesktop -nosplash Example, for C3SE Asking for one hour.

Set MATLAB job settings. Fill in the job settings on one of: HPC2N: CLUSTER=kebnekaise UPPMAX: no CLUSTER, as said above - i.e. just c=parcluster; LUNARC: CLUSTER=cosmos R2023b NSC: CLUSTER=tetralith C3SE: c=parcluster('local'); NO OTHER JOB SETTINGS! Here you start an interactive session first, as shown above! PDC: no CLUSTER , as said above - i.e. just c=parcluster; NO OTHER JOB SETTINGS! Here you instead start an interactive session first! Remember, the project-id is the compute allocation number given for your choice of cluster at the top of this webpage. Since we are just doing a short test, you can use 15 min instead of 1 hour. Also remember the c.AdditionalProperties.ProcsPerNode=20 if you are on UPPMAX. Test that the settings were added by viewing c.AdditionalProperties (not PDC or C3SE). Running a job from within the MATLAB terminal interface \u00b6 When starting a simple MATLAB program inside MATLAB on the terminal, by default, it will use your cluster profile which you just created and saved above. If you have a script file called myScript.m , the code to run it as a batch job with the default settings is: >> job = batch ( 'myScript' ); The batch command does not block MATLAB so you can continue working while computations take place. If you want to block MATLAB until the job finishes, use the wait function on the job object, like this: wait ( job ); By default, MATLAB saves the Command Window output from the batch job to the diary of the job. To retrieve it, use the diary function: diary ( job ) After the job finishes, fetch the results by using the load function: load ( job , 'x' ); or using the .fetchOutputs attribute: job . fetchOutputs {:} Tip Other useful job monitoring commands: If you need the Job id, run squeue --me on the command line. To get the MATLAB jobid do id=job.ID within MATLAB. To see if the job is running, inside MATLAB, do job.State Serial \u00b6 After starting MATLAB, you can get a handle to the cluster (remember, on Rackham/Pelle and Dardel, just use c=parcluster; ) like this: >> c = parcluster ( 'CLUSTER' ) For example, given that myfcn is a command or serial MATLAB program. N is the number of output arguments from the evaluated function x1, x2, x3,\u2026 are the input arguments then starting a batch job with these inputs would look like: j = c . batch (@ myfcn , N , { x1 , x2 , x3 , ... }) This job handle j then allows us to: Query the job status with j.State Fetch the result, if the job is finished, using j.fetchOutputs{:} , and Delete the job when it is not needed anymore using j.delete If you are running a lot of jobs, or if you want to quit MATLAB and restart it at a later time, you can retrieve the list of jobs and fetch the outputs of a specific job by index. For example: Get the list of jobs: jobs = c . Jobs Retrieve the output of the second job: j2 = jobs ( 2 ) output = j2 . fetchOutputs {:} Type-along. After doing the job settings further up, let us try running an example. We will use the example add2.m which adds two numbers. This example uses 1 and 2, but you can pick any numbers you want. You can find the add2.m script in the exercises/matlab directory or you can download it from here . Create a parcluster ( c=parcluster; or c=parcluster('CLUSTER'); or c=parcluster('local'=; Set up the job with job = c.batch(@add2, 1, {1,2}) Check if it has finished with job.State When it has finished, retrieve the result with job.fetchOutputs{:} Parallel \u00b6 Running parallel batch jobs are quite similar to running serial jobs. We just need to specify a MATLAB Pool to use and of course MATLAB code that is parallelized. This is easiest illustrated with an example. To make a pool of workers, and to give input etc., the basic syntax is: >> job = c . batch (@ SCRIPT , # output , { input1 , input2 , input3 , ... }, 'pool', #workers); Example: Running a simple MATLAB script, parallel-example.m, giving the input \u201c16\u201d, creating 4 workers, expecting 1 output. The name of the job handle is up to you (here it is j ). >> j = c . batch (@ parallel_example , 1 , { 16 }, 'pool' , 4 ); Let us try running this on Kebnekaise, including checking state and then getting output: >> j = c . batch (@ parallel_example , 1 , { 16 }, 'pool' , 4 ); additionalSubmitArgs = '--ntasks=5 --cpus-per-task=1 -A hpc2n2025-062 -t 01:00:00' >> j . State ans = 'running' >> j . State ans = 'finished' >> j . fetchOutputs {:} ans = 9.3387 >> Challenge 3. Try the above example. This exercise assumes you did the previous ones on this page; loading MATLAB, doing the configCluster.sh, adding the job settings. It should work on all the clusters. You can download parallel_example.m here . parpool \u00b6 On the clusters where this works, you can start a parpool and then (for instance) run a parallel code inside MATLAB. Parpool Example, for PDC: As shown earlier, first start an interactive session, login to the compute node you got, then load matlab and start it. Then create a parpool of the size (at most) that you asked for in number of cores. >> p = parpool ( 24 ) Starting parallel pool (parpool) using the 'Processes' profile ... connected to 24 workers. p = Pool with properties: Connected : true NumWorkers : 24 Cluster : local AttachedFiles : {} IdleTimeout : 30 minute ( s ) ( 30 minutes remaining ) SpmdEnabled : true >> parallel_example ans = 8.9287 There is more information about batch jobs here on Mathworks . Batch scripts containing MATLAB code \u00b6 Here we will discuss creating a batch script to run MATLAB in - Serial - Parallel While we can submit batch jobs (or even batch jobs of batch jobs) from inside MATLAB (and that may be the most common way of using the batch system with MATLAB), it is also possible to create a batch submit script and use that to run MATLAB. The difference here is that when the batch script has been submitted, you cannot make changes to your job. It is not interactive. That is also an advantage - you can submit the job, log out, and then come back later and see the results. Warning parpool can only be used on UPPMAX, Cosmos, Dardel, Kebnekaise, and Alvis. Serial batch jobs \u00b6 Here is an example of a serial batch job formatted for each of the 6 facilities covered.

Summary The SLURM scheduler handles allocations to the calculation/compute nodes Batch jobs run without interaction with user A batch script consists of a part with SLURM parameters describing the allocation and a second part describing the actual work within the job, for instance one or several MATLAB scripts. You can run MATLAB as a batch job through a batch script or from inside MATLAB (shell or GUI) Remember to include possible input arguments to the MATLAB script in the batch script. You need to configure MATLAB before submitting batch jobs (except on Dardel).","title":"MATLAB terminal and Slurm"},{"location":"matlab/slurmMatlab/#slurm-job-scheduler-and-matlab-in-terminal","text":"Objectives Understand and use the Slurm scheduler Configure the cluster Start (MATLAB) batch jobs from the command line Try example Important Compute allocations in this workshop Pelle/Rackham: uppmax2025-2-360 Kebnekaise: hpc2n2025-151 Cosmos: lu2025-2-94 Tetralith: naiss2025-22-934 Dardel: naiss2025-22-934 Alvis: naiss2025-22-934 Storage space for this workshop Rackham: /proj/r-matlab-julia-pelle Kebnekaise: /proj/nobackup/fall-courses Tetralith: /proj/courses-fall-2025/users/ Dardel: /cfs/klemming/projects/snic/courses-fall-2025 Alvis: /mimer/NOBACKUP/groups/courses-fall-2025/ Warning Any longer, resource-intensive, or parallel jobs must be run through a batch script . The batch system used at UPPMAX, HPC2N, LUNARC, NSC, and PDC is called SLURM. The same is the case at most of the Swedish HPC centres. SLURM is an Open Source job scheduler, which provides three key functions: - Keeps track of available system resources - Enforces local system resource usage and job scheduling policies - Manages a job queue, distributing work across resources according to policies Users ask for compute resources via the sbatch command (as those who attended yesterday\u2019s R session will already know). To run a batch job, you must create and submit a SLURM submit file (also called a batch submit file, a batch script, or a job script). Guides and documentation at: https://docs.hpc2n.umu.se/documentation/batchsystem/intro/ https://docs.uppmax.uu.se/cluster_guides/slurm/ https://lunarc-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/submitting_jobs/manual_basic_job/ https://www.nsc.liu.se/support/batch-jobs/introduction/ https://support.pdc.kth.se/doc/run_jobs/job_scheduling/ https://www.c3se.chalmers.se/documentation/submitting_jobs/running_jobs/ MATLAB is well integrated with SLURM, so there are several ways to run these jobs: Using the job scheduler ( batch command) in MATLAB Desktop/graphical interface (This is the Recommended Use). Starting a parpool with a predefined cluster (This allows for more interactivity). Writing a batch script as for any other software and submitting the job with the sbatch command from SLURM (This could be particularly useful if you want to run long jobs and you don\u2019t need to modify the code in the meantime). In the following sections we will extend these concepts.","title":"Slurm job scheduler and MATLAB in terminal"},{"location":"matlab/slurmMatlab/#useful-commands-to-the-batch-system","text":"Before going into MATLAB specifics for batch jobs, we should look briefly at some useful commands: Submit job: sbatch <jobscript.sh> Get list of your jobs: squeue --me Check on a specific job: scontrol show job <job-id> Delete a specific job: scancel <job-id> Useful info about a job: sacct -l -j <job-id> | less -S Url to a page with info about the job (Kebnekaise only): job-usage <job-id>","title":"Useful commands to the batch system"},{"location":"matlab/slurmMatlab/#first-time-configuration","text":"In order to be able to submit jobs to the SLURM queue, you usually need to configure MATLAB the first time you load any particular version. This configuration step will provide a set of default specifications for batch and parallel jobs called a cluster profile . Configuration only needs to be run once per version of MATLAB on each cluster. These specifications can be changed or added to at runtime, and it is possible to have more than one profile for a single release. The instructions for each facility are linked below: HPC2N: Configure MATLAB UPPMAX: MATLAB configuration LUNARC: Configuration at the command line NSC: MATLAB (scroll down to \u201cBefore submitting your first job\u201d) .

Do NOT run configCluster(.sh) on Dardel! For most clusters, configuration can be done at the regular terminal using a shell script called configCluster.sh . At most clusters, it is possible to run configCluster (without \u201c.sh\u201d) on the MATLAB command line; for NSC, this is the only way to run the configuration program.

Summary The SLURM scheduler handles allocations to the calculation/compute nodes Batch jobs run without interaction with user A batch script consists of a part with SLURM parameters describing the allocation and a second part describing the actual work within the job, for instance one or several MATLAB scripts. You can run MATLAB as a batch job through a batch script or from inside MATLAB (shell or GUI) Remember to include possible input arguments to the MATLAB script in the batch script. You need to configure MATLAB before submitting batch jobs (except on Dardel).","title":"Parallel batch script"},{"location":"r/batch/","text":"Running R in batch mode \u00b6 Questions What is a batch job?

The batch system used at UPPMAX, HPC2N, LUNARC, NSC, and PDC (and most other HPC centres in Sweden) is called Slurm. Slurm is an Open Source job scheduler, which provides three key functions Keeps track of available system resources Enforces local system resource usage and job scheduling policies Manages a job queue, distributing work across resources according to policies In order to run a batch job, you need to create and submit a SLURM submit file (also called a batch submit file, a batch script, or a job script). Guides and documentation at: https://docs.hpc2n.umu.se/documentation/batchsystem/intro/ and https://docs.uppmax.uu.se/cluster_guides/slurm/ and https://lunarc-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/manual_intro/ and https://www.nsc.liu.se/support/batch-jobs/introduction/ and https://support.pdc.kth.se/doc/support-docs/run_jobs/job_scheduling/ Workflow \u00b6 Write a batch script Inside the batch script you need to load the modules you need (R and any prerequisites) If you are using any own-installed packages, make sure R_LIBS_USER is set (export R_LIBS_USER=/path/to/my/R-packages) Ask for resources depending on if it is a parallel job or a serial job, if you need GPUs or not, etc. Give the command(s) to your R script Submit batch script with sbatch <my-batch-script-for-R.sh> Common file extensions for batch scripts are .sh or .batch , but they are not necessary. You can choose any name that makes sense to you. Useful commands to the batch system \u00b6 Submit job: sbatch <jobscript.sh> Get list of your jobs: squeue --me OR squeue -u <username> Check on a specific job: scontrol show job <job-id> Delete a specific job: scancel <job-id> Useful info about a job: sacct -l -j <job-id> | less -S Url to a page with info about the job (Kebnekaise only): job-usage <job-id> .. keypoints:: The Slurm scheduler handles allocations to the calculation nodes Interactive sessions was presented in the previous presentation Batch jobs runs without interaction with the user A batch script consists of a part with Slurm parameters describing the allocation and a second part describing the actual work within the job, for instance one or several R scripts. Remember to include possible input arguments to the R script in the batch script. Warning: Modules on Dardel If you are using Dardel, then note that there are 13 pre-loaded modules when you login, most of which are related to the machine being a Cray. If you do module purge there, they will all be removed together with the application software modules you wanted to purge. This may cause problems. List of modules that are pre-loaded (March 2025) and which will be removed with module purge : craype-x86-rome libfabric/1.20.1 craype-network-ofi perftools-base/23.12.0 xpmem/2.8.2-1.0_3.9__g84a27a5.shasta cce/17.0.0 craype/2.7.30 cray-dsmml/0.2.2 cray-mpich/8.1.28 cray-libsci/23.12.5 PrgEnv-cray/8.5.0 snic-env/1.0.0 You may have to reload all of these if you do module purge . The easiest solution is this: Immediately after logging in, and before loading any modules (assuming you have not added any to .bashrc do module save preload then, when you have done a module purge to remove some application software modules you have loaded (like R and prerequisites) and want to load a different version perhaps, do module restore preload That will restore the preloaded modules.

Warning: Modules on Dardel If you are using Dardel, then note that there are 13 pre-loaded modules when you login, most of which are related to the machine being a Cray. If you do module purge there, they will all be removed together with the application software modules you wanted to purge. This may cause problems. List of modules that are pre-loaded (March 2025) and which will be removed with module purge : craype-x86-rome libfabric/1.20.1 craype-network-ofi perftools-base/23.12.0 xpmem/2.8.2-1.0_3.9__g84a27a5.shasta cce/17.0.0 craype/2.7.30 cray-dsmml/0.2.2 cray-mpich/8.1.28 cray-libsci/23.12.5 PrgEnv-cray/8.5.0 snic-env/1.0.0 You may have to reload all of these if you do module purge . The easiest solution is this: Immediately after logging in, and before loading any modules (assuming you have not added any to .bashrc do module save preload then, when you have done a module purge to remove some application software modules you have loaded (like R and prerequisites) and want to load a different version perhaps, do module restore preload That will restore the preloaded modules.","title":"Useful commands to the batch system"},{"location":"r/batch/#example-r-batch-scripts","text":"","title":"Example R batch scripts"},{"location":"r/batch/#serial-code","text":"Type-along Short serial batch example for running the code hello.R UPPMAX HPC2N LUNARC NSC PDC C3SE hello.R Short serial example script for Pelle.

Warning (HPC2N) Do note that it (salloc) is not real interactivity as you probably mean it, as you will have to run it as a R script instead of by starting R and giving commands inside it. The reason for this is that you are not actually logged into the compute node and only sees the output of the commands you run. You also need to preface with srun or it will run on the login node. The way to get real interactivity at HPC2N is to use the Open OnDemand desktop (https://portal.hpc2n.umu.se) R \u201cinteractively\u201d on the compute nodes \u00b6 To run interactively, you need to allocate resources on the cluster first. You can use the command salloc / interactive to allow interactive use of resources allocated to your job. When the resources are allocated, if you are using HPC2N and salloc you need to preface commands with srun in order to run on the allocated nodes instead of the login node. First, you make a request for resources with interactive / salloc , like this: UPPMAX (interactive) HPC2N (salloc) LUNARC (interactive) NSC (interactive) PDC (salloc + ssh) C3SE $ interactive -n <tasks> --time = HHH:MM:SS -A uppmax2025-2-360 $ salloc -n <tasks> --time = HHH:MM:SS -A hpc2n2024-025 interactive -A lu2025-2-94 -t HHH:MM:SS interactive -A naiss2025-22-934 salloc --time = HHH:MM:SS -A naiss2025-22-934 -p [ partition ] Where [partition] is main or gpu. After your resources have been allocated, you can login to the compute node with ssh <node> and have real interactivity. srun -A NAISS2025-22-934 -p alvis --gpus-per-node = T4:1 --pty bash Your request enters the job queue just like any other job, and interactive/salloc will tell you that it is waiting for the requested resources. When salloc tells you that your job has been allocated resources, you can interactively run programs on those resources with srun (or login to the compute node with ssh on PDC). The commands you run with srun will then be executed on the resources your job has been allocated. If you do not preface with srun the command is run on the login node! You can now run R scripts on the allocated resources directly instead of waiting for your batch job to return a result. This is an advantage if you want to test your R script or perhaps figure out which parameters are best.

The reason for this is that you are not actually logged into the compute node and only sees the output of the commands you run. You also need to preface with srun or it will run on the login node. The way to get real interactivity at HPC2N is to use the Open OnDemand desktop (https://portal.hpc2n.umu.se)","title":"General"},{"location":"r/interactive/#r-interactively-on-the-compute-nodes","text":"To run interactively, you need to allocate resources on the cluster first. You can use the command salloc / interactive to allow interactive use of resources allocated to your job. When the resources are allocated, if you are using HPC2N and salloc you need to preface commands with srun in order to run on the allocated nodes instead of the login node. First, you make a request for resources with interactive / salloc , like this: UPPMAX (interactive) HPC2N (salloc) LUNARC (interactive) NSC (interactive) PDC (salloc + ssh) C3SE $ interactive -n <tasks> --time = HHH:MM:SS -A uppmax2025-2-360 $ salloc -n <tasks> --time = HHH:MM:SS -A hpc2n2024-025 interactive -A lu2025-2-94 -t HHH:MM:SS interactive -A naiss2025-22-934 salloc --time = HHH:MM:SS -A naiss2025-22-934 -p [ partition ] Where [partition] is main or gpu. After your resources have been allocated, you can login to the compute node with ssh <node> and have real interactivity. srun -A NAISS2025-22-934 -p alvis --gpus-per-node = T4:1 --pty bash Your request enters the job queue just like any other job, and interactive/salloc will tell you that it is waiting for the requested resources. When salloc tells you that your job has been allocated resources, you can interactively run programs on those resources with srun (or login to the compute node with ssh on PDC). The commands you run with srun will then be executed on the resources your job has been allocated. If you do not preface with srun the command is run on the login node! You can now run R scripts on the allocated resources directly instead of waiting for your batch job to return a result. This is an advantage if you want to test your R script or perhaps figure out which parameters are best.

R packages: A short Primer \u00b6 What is a package, really? \u00b6 An R package is essentially a contained folder and file structure containing R code (and possibly C/C++ or other code) and other files relevant for the package e.g. documentation(vignettes), licensing and configuration files. Let us look at a very simple example $ git clone https://github.com/MatPiq/R_example.git $ cd R_example $ tree . \u251c\u2500\u2500 DESCRIPTION \u251c\u2500\u2500 NAMESPACE \u251c\u2500\u2500 R \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 hello.R \u251c\u2500\u2500 man \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 hello.Rd \u2514\u2500\u2500 r_example.Rproj Installing tree as non-root on Linux Ubuntu If you are on a Linux Ubuntu system where tree is not installed, and you do not have root permissions, you can do this to install it in your own area 1) Create a directory (in your home folder) to install in: mkdir ~/mytree Change to that directory: cd ~/mytree Now download tree: apt download tree Unpack the files: dpkg-deb -xv ./*deb ./ You can use tree like this now, giving the full path: ~/mytree/usr/bin/tree Note : if you want to be able to use it with the command \u201ctree\u201d you could set an alias in your ~/.bashrc file and then source it: echo 'alias tree=\"$HOME/mytree/usr/bin/tree\"' >> ~/.bashrc source ~/.bashrc Package states \u00b6 An R packages can exist in five possible states Source: \u201csource code\u201d or \u201csource files\u201d. Development form. Bundled: The source code compressed into a single file, usually tar.gz and sometimes referred to as \u201csource tarballs\u201d. Files in .Rbuildignore are excluded. Binary: A compressed and pre-compiled version of a bundle built for a specific architecture. Usually how the package is provided by CRAN. Much faster than having to compile yourself and no need for dev/build tools. Installed: A decompressed binary package located in a package library (more on this later). In-memory: When the installed package has been loaded from the library into memory, using require(pkg) or library(pkg) . Source: https://r-pkgs.org/structure.html and https://nbisweden.github.io/RaukR-2021/rpackages_Sebastian/presentation/rpackages_Sebastian.html Finding out if an R package is installed \u00b6 There are many different ways to check if the package you are after is already installed - chances are it is! The simplest way is probably to simply try loading the package from within R library(package-name) Another option would be to create a dataframe of all the installed packages ip <- as.data.frame ( installed.packages ()[, c ( 1 , 3 : 4 )]) rownames ( ip ) <- NULL ip <- ip [ is.na ( ip $ Priority ), 1 : 2 , drop = FALSE ] print ( ip , row.names = FALSE ) However, this might not be so helpful unless you do additional filtering. Another simple option is to grep the library directory. For example, both when loading R_packages at UPPMAX and R-bundle-Bioconductor at HPC2N the environment variable R_LIBS_SITE will be set to the path of the package library.

The solution to this is to install your own packages. These packages will usually come from CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/) - the Comprehensive R Archive Network, or sometimes from other places, like GitHub or R-Forge Here we will look at installing R packages with automatic download and with manual download. It is also possible to install from inside Rstudio. Setup \u00b6 We need to create a place for the own-installed packages to be and to tell R where to find them. The initial setup only needs to be done once, but separate package directories need to be created for each R version used. R reads the $HOME/.Renviron file to setup its environment. It should be created by R on first run, or you can create it with the command: touch $HOME/.Renviron NOTE : In this example we are going to assume you have chosen to place the R packages in a directory under your home directory, but in general it might be good to use the project storage for space reasons. As mentioned, you will need separate ones for each R version. If you have not yet installed any packages to R yourself, the environment file should be empty and you can update it like this: $ echo R_LIBS_USER = \" $HOME /R-packages-%V\" > ~/.Renviron Warning If it is not empty , you can edit $HOME/.Renviron with your favorite editor so that R_LIBS_USER contains the path to your chosen directory for own-installed R packages. It should look something like this when you are done: $ R_LIBS_USER = \"/home/u/user/R-packages-%V\" NOTE Replace /home/u/user with the value of $HOME . Run echo $HOME to see its value. NOTE The %V should be written as-is, it\u2019s substituted at runtime with the active R version. For each version of R you are using, create a directory matching the pattern used in .Renviron to store your packages in. This example is shown for R version 4.1.1: $ mkdir -p $HOME /R-packages-4.1.1 Automatical download and install from CRAN \u00b6 Note You find a list of packages in CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/) and a list of repos here: https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html Please choose a location close to you when picking a repo. From command line From inside R $ R --quiet --no-save --no-restore -e \"install.packages('<r-package>', repos='<repo>')\" install.packages ( '<r-package>' , repos = '<repo>' ) In either case, the dependencies of the package will be downloaded and installed as well. Example \u00b6 In this example, we will install the R package stringr and use the repository http://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/CRAN/ Note : You need to load R (and any prerequisites, and possibly R-bundle-Bioconductor if you need packages from that) before installing packages. From command line From inside R $ R --quiet --no-save --no-restore -e \"install.packages('stringr', repos='http://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/CRAN/')\" install.packages ( 'stringr' , repos = 'http://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/CRAN/' ) There are other ways to install R packages, including from GitHub. Automatic download and install from GitHub \u00b6 If you want to install a package that is not on CRAN, but which do have a GitHub page, then there is an automatic way of installing, but you need to handle prerequsites yourself by installing those first. It can also be that the package is not in as finished a state as those on CRAN, so be careful. To install packages from GitHub directly, from inside R, you first need to install the devtools package.

Instead of writing code yourself there may be others that have done the same! Many scientific tools are distributed as R packages . This makes it possible to just run a script from the prompt. You can define files to be analysed and use arguments to define exactly what to do. For more details about packages and in particular developing your own, see: R packages Questions What is an R package? How do I find which packages and versions are available? What to do if I need other packages? Are there differences between HPC2N, UPPMAX, LUNARC, NSC, and PDC? Objectives Check if an R package is installed Load and use R packages Install R packages yourself Package libraries \u00b6 In R, a library is a directory containing installed packages, sort of like a library for books. Unfortunately, in the R world, you will frequently encounter confused usage of the words \u201clibrary\u201d and \u201cpackage\u201d. It\u2019s common for someone to refer to dplyr, for example, as a library when it is actually a package (Wickham & Hadley, 2023). We might want to know where the R interpreter will be searching for packages, i.e. where the libraries are located (could be several). The easiest way to check is probably starting the interpreter and running the libPaths() function. NSC PDC UPPMAX HPC2N LUNARC C3SE Load R , e.g. version 4.2.2 and start the Interpreter $ ml R/4.2.2-hpc1-gcc-11.3.0-bare $ R Then check find the path of the library using the libPaths() function. > .libPaths () [ 1 ] \"/software/sse2/tetralith_el9/manual/R/4.2.2/g11/hpc1/lib64/R/library\" Load R , e.g. version 4.4.1 and start the Interpreter $ ml PDC/23.12 R/4.4.1-cpeGNU-23.12 $ R Then check find the path of the library using the libPaths() function. > .libPaths () [ 1 ] \"/cfs/klemming/home/b/bbrydsoe/.R/23.12/4.4.1/library\" [ 2 ] \"/cfs/klemming/pdc/software/dardel/23.12/eb/software/R/4.4.1-cpeGNU-23.12/lib64/R/library\" > Load R , e.g. version 4.4.2 and start the Interpreter $ ml R/4.4.2-gfbf-2024a $ R Then check find the path of the library using the libPaths() function. > .libPaths () [ 1 ] \"/sw/arch/eb/software/R/4.4.2-gfbf-2024a/lib64/R/library\" Load R , e.g. version R/4.4.1 and start the Interpreter $ ml GCC/13.2.0 R/4.4.1 $ R Then check find the path of the library using the libPaths() function. > [ 1 ] \"/cvmfs/ebsw.hpc2n.umu.se/amd64_ubuntu2004_bdw/software/R/4.4.1-gfbf-2023b/lib/R/library\" Load R , e.g. version 4.2.1 and start the Interpreter $ ml GCC/11.3.0 OpenMPI/4.1.4 R/4.2.1 $ R Then check find the path of the library using the libPaths() function. > .libPaths () [ 1 ] \"/home/bbrydsoe/R-packages-4.2.1\" [ 2 ] \"/sw/easybuild_milan/software/R/4.2.1-foss-2022a/lib64/R/library\" Load R , e.g. version 4.2.1 and start the Interpreter $ ml R/4.2.1-foss-2022a $ R Then check to find the path of the library using the libPaths() function. > .libPaths () [ 1 ] \"/apps/Arch/software/R/4.2.1-foss-2022a/lib64/R/library\" > Warning: Modules on Dardel If you are using Dardel, then note that there are 13 pre-loaded modules when you login, most of which are related to the machine being a Cray. If you do module purge there, they will all be removed together with the application software modules you wanted to purge. This may cause problems. List of modules that are pre-loaded (March 2025) and which will be removed with module purge : craype-x86-rome libfabric/1.20.1 craype-network-ofi perftools-base/23.12.0 xpmem/2.8.2-1.0_3.9__g84a27a5.shasta cce/17.0.0 craype/2.7.30 cray-dsmml/0.2.2 cray-mpich/8.1.28 cray-libsci/23.12.5 PrgEnv-cray/8.5.0 snic-env/1.0.0 You may have to reload all of these if you do module purge . The easiest solution is this: Immediately after logging in, and before loading any modules (assuming you have not added any to .bashrc do module save preload then, when you have done a module purge to remove some application software modules you have loaded (like R and prerequisites) and want to load a different version perhaps, do module restore preload That will restore the preloaded modules. Preinstalled package libraries \u00b6 UPPMAX, HPC2N, LUNARC, NSC, and PDC all offer larger or smaller amounts of preinstalled packages. HPC2N On HPC2N it depends on the version, but for R/4.4.1 only a smaller number of these (around 110 packages) come with the R module, but additional ones are in the R-bundle-Bioconductor . Most of the packages are in the module R-bundle-CRAN and a few more in R-bundle-CRAN-extra . For older versions of R, most packages come with the R module (around 750 packages). Older versions of R also usually have OpenMPI as prerequisite. Use module spider <module>/<version> to check for prerequisites, as usual. UPPMAX On UPPMAX the module R contains only a smaller number of packages (110), but almost all packages in the CRAN and BioConductor repositories are in the R-bundle-CRAN respectively R-bundle-Bioconductor modules. LUNARC On LUNARC most of the R packages come with the R module. NSC On NSC, a small number of the R packages come with the R module. You will have to install the rest yourself. PDC On PDC about 250 packages come with the R module. C3SE On Alvis at C3SE, around 1340 packages are installed with R/4.2.1 - but much fewer with R/4.3.3. There are many different ways to check if the package you are after is already installed - chances are it is! The simplest way is probably to simply try loading the package from within R (you can also get a list of all packages with installed.packages() but that can be overwhelming): library ( package - name ) To learn about other ways, see the page \u201cMore about R packages\u201d under \u201cExtra reading\u201d in the left menu. Exercise Start R (remember to load a module + prerequisites if you have not already). Check if the packages pillar and caret are installed, as shown above. UPPMAX (Pelle) HPC2N LUNARC NSC PDC C3SE Solution If you want, you can try loading the libraries inside R without loading either the R-bundle-CRAN or R-bundle-Bioconductor modules and see that almost nothing is installed. $ module load R-bundle-CRAN/2024.11-foss-2024a R-bundle-Bioconductor/3.20-foss-2024a-R-4.4.2 # You'll get R/4.4.2-gfbf-2024a on the fly! $ R R version 4 .4.2 ( 2024 -10-31 ) -- \"Pile of Leaves\" Copyright ( C ) 2024 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu R is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.

Note Places to look for R packages CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/) R-Forge (https://r-forge.r-project.org/) Project\u2019s own GitHub page etc. Keypoints You can check for installed packages from inside R with installed.packages() from BASH shell with the ml help R/<version> at UPPMAX ml spider R/<version> at HPC2N ml spider R/<version> at LUNARC ml spider R/version> at NSC ml spider R/version> at PDC Installation of R packages can be done either from within R or from the command line (BASH shell) CRAN is the recommended place to look for R-packages, but many packages can be found on GitHub and if you want the development version of a package you likely need to get it from GitHub or other place outside CRAN. You would then either download and install manually or install with something like devtools, from within R. Extra example, NSC \u00b6 For NSC you need to install doParallel and foreach , and pbdMPI (since Rmpi does not work) yourself to do the exercises in the section about batch. You can either do that now, exactly the same way a above for nuggets or you do it later today, during the batch session. If you have the setup done, and R loaded, then: Start R Then install.packages('foreach', repos='http://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/CRAN/') and install.packages('doParallel', repos='http://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/CRAN/') and install.packages('pbdMPI', repos='http://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/CRAN/') Extra example, PDC \u00b6 For PDC the package Rmpi does not work correctly, so we will instead use the package pbdMPI , which you need to install yourself to do one of the exercises in the advanced section about parallelism. You can either do that now, or you can do it that day, during the parallel session. If you have the setup done, and the R module loaded, then (on the command line, not inside R): First copy the tarball: cp /cfs/klemming/projects/snic/r-matlab-julia-naiss/pbdMPI_0.5-2.tar.gz . while standing in your own directory that you are running R scripts from. Then do: R CMD INSTALL pbdMPI_0.5-2.tar.gz --configure-args=\" --with-mpi-include=/opt/cray/pe/mpich/8.1.28/ofi/gnu/12.3/include --with-mpi-libpath=/opt/cray/pe/mpich/8.1.28/ofi/gnu/12.3/lib --with-mpi-type=MPICH2\" --no-test-load Install own packages on Bianca \u00b6 If an R package is not not available on Bianca already (like Conda repositories) you may have to use the wharf to install the library/package Typical workflow Install on Rackham Transfer to Wharf Move package to local Bianca R package path Test your installation Demo and exercise from our Bianca course: Installing R packages on Bianca <https://uppmax.github.io/bianca_workshops/extra/rpackages/> _ Exercises \u00b6 Install a package with automatic download First do the setup of .Renviron and create the directory for installing R packages (Recommended load R version 4.4.1 on Pelle, 4.1.2 on Kebnekaise, 4.2.1 on LUNARC, 4.2.2 on NSC, and 4.4.1 on PDC) From the command line.

Unfortunately, in the R world, you will frequently encounter confused usage of the words \u201clibrary\u201d and \u201cpackage\u201d. It\u2019s common for someone to refer to dplyr, for example, as a library when it is actually a package (Wickham & Hadley, 2023). We might want to know where the R interpreter will be searching for packages, i.e. where the libraries are located (could be several).

HPC2N On HPC2N it depends on the version, but for R/4.4.1 only a smaller number of these (around 110 packages) come with the R module, but additional ones are in the R-bundle-Bioconductor . Most of the packages are in the module R-bundle-CRAN and a few more in R-bundle-CRAN-extra . For older versions of R, most packages come with the R module (around 750 packages). Older versions of R also usually have OpenMPI as prerequisite. Use module spider <module>/<version> to check for prerequisites, as usual. UPPMAX On UPPMAX the module R contains only a smaller number of packages (110), but almost all packages in the CRAN and BioConductor repositories are in the R-bundle-CRAN respectively R-bundle-Bioconductor modules. LUNARC On LUNARC most of the R packages come with the R module. NSC On NSC, a small number of the R packages come with the R module. You will have to install the rest yourself. PDC On PDC about 250 packages come with the R module. C3SE On Alvis at C3SE, around 1340 packages are installed with R/4.2.1 - but much fewer with R/4.3.3. There are many different ways to check if the package you are after is already installed - chances are it is! The simplest way is probably to simply try loading the package from within R (you can also get a list of all packages with installed.packages() but that can be overwhelming): library ( package - name ) To learn about other ways, see the page \u201cMore about R packages\u201d under \u201cExtra reading\u201d in the left menu.

The initial setup only needs to be done once, but separate package directories need to be created for each R version used. R reads the $HOME/.Renviron file to setup its environment. It should be created by R on first run, or you can create it with the command: touch $HOME/.Renviron NOTE : In this example we are going to assume you have chosen to place the R packages in a directory under your home directory, but in general it might be good to use the project storage for space reasons. As mentioned, you will need separate ones for each R version. If you have not yet installed any packages to R yourself, the environment file should be empty and you can update it like this: $ echo R_LIBS_USER = \" $HOME /R-packages-%V\" > ~/.Renviron Warning If it is not empty , you can edit $HOME/.Renviron with your favorite editor so that R_LIBS_USER contains the path to your chosen directory for own-installed R packages. It should look something like this when you are done: $ R_LIBS_USER = \"/home/u/user/R-packages-%V\" NOTE Replace /home/u/user with the value of $HOME . Run echo $HOME to see its value. NOTE The %V should be written as-is, it\u2019s substituted at runtime with the active R version. NOTE At Dardel (PDC) the path is /cfs/klemming/home/u/user but you can see it with echo $HOME . For each version of R you are using, create a directory matching the pattern used in .Renviron to store your packages in. This example is shown for R version 4.1.1 (change to version suitable for your centre): $ mkdir -p $HOME /R-packages-4.1.1 Note If you will be installing many R packages yourself, it is a good idea to place them in your project storage instead, as they can take up a lot of space and your home directory is not very large. In that case you would instead do the setup as: $ echo R_LIBS_USER = \"<path-to-your-space-on-proj-storage>/R-packages-%V\" > ~/.Renviron And then create directories for each R version you use there, like this, for R/4.1.1.

What went well: [W1] Working as a team [W2] All students (that could log in) completed their exercises within time [W3] We tried out something new: a new format for the evaluation [W4] Collecting feedback during the lessons [W5] Using a shared document What could be improved: [I1] Lengths of the course parts [I2] Remember to schedule a moment for all students to help them log in [I3] Evaluation before Q&A [I4] Install Python package: actually install something in the demo [I5] Me being a good team member [I6] Tell students clearly what to do: observe or type along or do an exercise [I7] No questions in Zoom chat, use shared doc only To discuss: [D1] Allow students that have not logged in yet? [D2] Shouldn\u2019t this material be at the regular UPPMAX website? [W1] Working as a team \u00b6 I was very happy to be part of this team of Birgitte, Bj\u00f6rn and Pedro, as its members seems quite diverse: Birgitte: most knowledge of general things Bj\u00f6rn: the most all-around-nice-guy Pedro: most knowledgeable in parallel computing As Bj\u00f6rn was the only one to have sysadmin rights, he was the one to get learners to login, which he did as much as he could. Both Birgitte and Bj\u00f6rn impressed me by answering complex questions during lectures! Also, already after the lecture, me and Bj\u00f6rn discussed how to improve the course next time. We especially discussed learners that could not log in. Bj\u00f6rn stated there are good reasons to allow these learners to participate in the course, so we chose not to disallow these. Instead, we think it would be a good idea to have a moment scheduled for the learners before the course, for those that could not log in yet. [W2] All students (that could log in) completed their exercises within time \u00b6 Between 10:00-10:45, all students (that could log in) had completed their exercises at 10:15. Between 11:00-11:45, all students (that could log in) had completed their exercises at 11:30. Due to a request by Birgitte, they had to create another venv, which they then all did within a couple of minutes too. At 13:30-13:45, I\u2019d have had 15 mins to do Jupyter notebook on Rackham, which was moved to 13:45-13:55. I felt 15 mins would have been enough, 10 mins was too short. At 14:00-14:25, I and the Rackham learners did an exercises on interactive and conda. I think it was enough time. Note that creating a new conda environment takes 13 minutes, which I used to talk about Python things with the learners. [W3] We tried out something new: a new format for the evaluation \u00b6 I am happy that the team tried out a new format for the evaluation. Already at the end of the day, we discussed already the pros and cons of it and we\u2019ll try out another format directly the day after! [W4] Collecting feedback during the lessons \u00b6 During the exercises, I went through the Zoom rooms to check that all students knew what to do, had questions and/or have remarks. Also the shared document helped to collect feedback during the lesson. [W5] Using a shared document \u00b6 The shared document helped to collect questions and feedback during the lesson. [I1] Lengths of the course parts \u00b6 Topic Was scheduled Actual time used Suggested time packages 45 mins 15 mins 30 mins venv 45 mins 15 mins 30 mins Jupyter 15 mins 15 mins 15 mins conda 25 mins 25 mins 30 mins I/we could not predict the lengths of the topics. For \u2018packages\u2019 and \u2018venv\u2019, the learners had much time left. It is unsure if that is due to (1) me having too simple exercises, (2) my way of teaching compared to the previous time (but it is unclear in which way it differed) (3) the learners were quicker too learn this time. Maybe next time, we\u2019ll find out :-) [I2] Remember to schedule a moment for all students to help them log in \u00b6 There were 4 students out of 28 that could not log in yet. Although they behaved well, it took away time of other students. Bj\u00f6rn stated there are good reasons to allow these learners to participate in the course. However, we forgot to schedule a moment for the learners to log in before the course. [I3] Evaluation before Q&A \u00b6 During the Q&A, which was before the evaluation, a third of the students left, as there was only 1 person talking at the same time. Note that at the end of the day, we discussed this and we would change the order the day after. [I4] Install Python package: actually install something in the demo \u00b6 In the YouTube video, the install failed, due to package version conflicts. Make a new video where something is actually installed [I5] Me being a good team member \u00b6 I was doing so much teaching, that I only had a third of the time needed to prepare. I decided to prepare ruthlessly, ignoring email and other comms for some weeks. I knew this would be annoying to the team, yet I trusted the team would make the right decisions without me. [I6] Tell students clearly what to do: observe or type along or do an exercise \u00b6 There was this feedback given during the lesson: a student asked to another instructor: \u2018Should we watch or type along?\u2019. I agree with her that this always should be clear. I thanked her in a breakout room for this. I know I am imperfect on this too. [I7] No questions in Zoom chat, use shared doc only \u00b6 The course used two communication channels: the Zoom chat and the shared doc. This was needlessly confusing. Next time, only use the shared doc. Feedback \u00b6 Spoken evaluation 2023-10-19 \u00b6 Number of learners: 12 Feedback: 2x The course is well organized! Teachers do not distinguish enough between the different UPPMAX clusters on the first day, however, this was fixed on day 3 :-) Day 3 was slightly better than Day 1 (both were good!), with the advice: on Day 1, take more for ThinLinc and interactive Everything was quite good, especially SLURM, better than some other UPPMAX course. This was mostly due to, today, doing exercises step by step and having enough time to follow ThinLinc was of correct length today, on Day 1 indeed a little bit too short All the instructors should use the same R version, because else you need to load a different R module Google Form evaluations \u00b6 These are the results of the Google Forms evaluation. The responses are sorted alphabetically or in other ways that make sense. Note that the anonymous evaluation overlaps quite well with the anonymous Google Form. Overall, how would you rate today\u2019s training event? \u00b6 5: 1x 6: 3x 7: 5x 8: 1x 9: 2x Hmmm that is quite some variation there\u2026 Today\u2019s content and feedback to the lecturers (e.g. materials, exercises, structure): \u2013 What did you like best? \u00b6 Cou[r]se materials are really nicely put together Formatted ReadTheDocs Good material I liked how easy it was to ask questions, how friendly the lecturers / organizers were and that there was time for trying it yourself. The course material is really nice to read and helpful. This is nice to hear! I liked the \u2018code along\u2019 parts, when it worked and was an appropriate pace one could actually follow. Unsure if this about mine or Birgittes parts :-| Materials That materials were extensive and provided (both in advance and during the day). The break-out session was good to let me ask the stupid questions to fellows that could help out or make me catch up. The goal of the break-out sessions has been achieved :-) The instructions and code given in the course material on GitHub Very good material, but a bit chaotic Unsure what this is about. I assume it is about my course material that was not embedded in the existing course material. I will fix this in the future. materials structure Today\u2019s content and feedback to the lecturers (e.g. materials, exercises, structure): \u2013 Where should we improve? \u00b6 Create one single entrance point for all the material where links to the rest are to be found. I got lost with five or more different links, folders and the information overflow as it got started. I also missed the big picture of the super computer (no previous experience), how the different systems are related, the main difference of Rackham and hp2cn/kebnekaise and so on. I felt I have too little information to make informed choices. For example, it would be easier if everybody used the same server, and only one\u2026 I agree I should harmonize the course material more. For some tasks, there was too much time allocated, for example for the pip installs at the start. I would suggest checking in with students more frequently about if they are done or not, and then continuing. Or students could be instructed to join the main room again when they are done. This way, if someone takes longer, you could see who is left in the breakout rooms and check in with them. I agree that we mistimed some sessions and we already plan to change that. The Zoom breakout room setup is intentional: we do checkup regularly with the students and we do not call the students back when all are done earlier. I feel this gives rest and clarity to the course. It looked like everything was rushed up and it was not clear what we were supposed to do in the breakout rooms After each exercise, the instructors always checked if the learners understood what to do. Most students usually knew what to do. It will be good if you give a small introduction about different uppmax servers and what are the differences at the beginning of the course. Maybe. Lectures should be given more time (or the contents reduced). Unfortunately it was at times a hard to follow. Perhaps, also, make it a bit more clear what is expected from the exercises. Maybe actually follow the material that is there. It\u2019s hard for us to do exercises and go back and check later when one of the presenters just had his own material. Also, maybe make actual parallel sessions instead of going break rooms. Too much time in break rooms in general, and then other sections got rushed. I agree, I should harmonize the materials. Maybe have two streams, since most Python programmers already know about venv, etc. We cannot. There are plans to teach other courses at two different levels, so that we split absolute beginners from the more advanced students. Much more time spent on code along and instructions, this would improve the course a lot I think! I understand and respect that for you this is very clear and it flows really easily. But for us who is watching over zoom: scrolling up and down fast while screen sharing makes it impossible to follow; as it is over zoom the instructions for the exercise part needs to be much clearer in my view, also do this - BEFORE - entering breakout rooms; additional thought about exercises is what really are the exercises, the ones stated at the end of each lecture part or the text/instructions embedded in the \u2018slides\u2019 in the instruction pages; the \u2018messages\u2019 that can be sent out to the breakout rooms are hard to notice sometimes while working on exercise, perhaps paste this in chat and/or document so one can re-read; please specify clearly how long a task \u2018should\u2019 take approx. (is the whole time in breakout rooms dedicated to the assigned task, or is the time also there for break); specify in start of each part/\u2018lecture\u2019 what the plan is maybe?; \u2018slides\u2019 can be a bit clearer I would say. Thank you, though! I understand that this is no easy feat to lecture and teach HPC over zoom. You didi a great job, but these are things I wish for at least. I like this extensive feedback! To compensate for unclear instructions (to some) for a breakout-room exercise, we teachers always visited the break-out rooms directly after the exercise started. I remember being unclear with the time on purpose (or was that another course?) and I felt it was preferred to be vague over setting a time that would possible be changed, to add to the tranquility. Comment from 2024-01-24: I am happy to see I took this feedback seriously, practiced this and forgot it was based on this!

I got lost with five or more different links, folders and the information overflow as it got started. I also missed the big picture of the super computer (no previous experience), how the different systems are related, the main difference of Rackham and hp2cn/kebnekaise and so on. I felt I have too little information to make informed choices. For example, it would be easier if everybody used the same server, and only one\u2026 I agree I should harmonize the course material more. For some tasks, there was too much time allocated, for example for the pip installs at the start. I would suggest checking in with students more frequently about if they are done or not, and then continuing. Or students could be instructed to join the main room again when they are done. This way, if someone takes longer, you could see who is left in the breakout rooms and check in with them. I agree that we mistimed some sessions and we already plan to change that. The Zoom breakout room setup is intentional: we do checkup regularly with the students and we do not call the students back when all are done earlier. I feel this gives rest and clarity to the course. It looked like everything was rushed up and it was not clear what we were supposed to do in the breakout rooms After each exercise, the instructors always checked if the learners understood what to do. Most students usually knew what to do. It will be good if you give a small introduction about different uppmax servers and what are the differences at the beginning of the course. Maybe. Lectures should be given more time (or the contents reduced). Unfortunately it was at times a hard to follow. Perhaps, also, make it a bit more clear what is expected from the exercises. Maybe actually follow the material that is there. It\u2019s hard for us to do exercises and go back and check later when one of the presenters just had his own material. Also, maybe make actual parallel sessions instead of going break rooms. Too much time in break rooms in general, and then other sections got rushed. I agree, I should harmonize the materials. Maybe have two streams, since most Python programmers already know about venv, etc. We cannot. There are plans to teach other courses at two different levels, so that we split absolute beginners from the more advanced students. Much more time spent on code along and instructions, this would improve the course a lot I think! I understand and respect that for you this is very clear and it flows really easily. But for us who is watching over zoom: scrolling up and down fast while screen sharing makes it impossible to follow; as it is over zoom the instructions for the exercise part needs to be much clearer in my view, also do this - BEFORE - entering breakout rooms; additional thought about exercises is what really are the exercises, the ones stated at the end of each lecture part or the text/instructions embedded in the \u2018slides\u2019 in the instruction pages; the \u2018messages\u2019 that can be sent out to the breakout rooms are hard to notice sometimes while working on exercise, perhaps paste this in chat and/or document so one can re-read; please specify clearly how long a task \u2018should\u2019 take approx. (is the whole time in breakout rooms dedicated to the assigned task, or is the time also there for break); specify in start of each part/\u2018lecture\u2019 what the plan is maybe?; \u2018slides\u2019 can be a bit clearer I would say. Thank you, though! I understand that this is no easy feat to lecture and teach HPC over zoom. You didi a great job, but these are things I wish for at least. I like this extensive feedback! To compensate for unclear instructions (to some) for a breakout-room exercise, we teachers always visited the break-out rooms directly after the exercise started. I remember being unclear with the time on purpose (or was that another course?) and I felt it was preferred to be vague over setting a time that would possible be changed, to add to the tranquility. Comment from 2024-01-24: I am happy to see I took this feedback seriously, practiced this and forgot it was based on this!

This iteration, my material was 100% part of the course website and I removed the presentation slides from the previous iteration. Although I did invest 10 + 2 + 16 + 2 = 30 hours, with little sleep, the day of teaching went fine. The most obvious problem during teaching was that Zoom did not allow me to speak or show video, in the main room, when breakout rooms are active. I think we dealt with this technical problem as good as we reasonably could. However, due to it, I cannot properly evaluate my own lessons. I was annoyed with being this blind as a teacher: how can I know if the learners understood, if I cannot see their exercises? Also, I did not do a half-way-during-the-exercise feedback, nor a nearly-the-end-of-the-hour feedback. And I was unable to see if the exercise lengths matched the time allocated. There were some mistakes: [Fixed] The exercises on venv failed due to the install of a package in the session before. Next time, ruthlessly delete the /home/richel/.local/lib/python3.11 folder. I\u2019ve added this to the course material I could not demo going into the remote desktop website of Rackham. Repeat this next time! I feel that is as much as I have to reflect on. I think it went quite smoothly when correcting for the technical error. Discussion on other sections \u00b6 Pre-requirements \u00b6 I feel the pre-requirements page, [URL] , is too extensive. I feel it should link to regular documentation and mostly show how to determine you fulfilled all pre-requirements. Interactive \u00b6 The session on starting an interactive session feels too fancy twice: create an interactive session with 1 node with more nodes <\u2014 feels beyond the teaching goals run 2 Python scripts, 1 of which is unsuitable for an interactive session with more nodes. I think, for 15 minutes, one can only do 1 node and no Python script, to achieve the teaching goals. Impressed by Birgitte \u00b6 I think it was impressive that Birgitte logs in into both clusters at the start. I want that too! Why ssh -Y \u00b6 Unrelated to the course, Birgitte does so. Loading Python \u00b6 If the session is about loading Python, maybe seeing module dependencies can removed. Also, don\u2019t care about python3? Also, don\u2019t care about IPython? Suggest to Arvid \u00b6 The Bianca portal is great. Could you do the same for Rackham? Not every user understands one needs to use 2FA now, and how More time for sbatch \u00b6 There was no time for an exercise. I would have enjoy to be sure that the learners have been able to submit a job and see the results. More time for GPU \u00b6 There was no time for an exercise. More time for UPPMAX interactive and Jupyter \u00b6 There was no time for an exercise. Parallel programming \u00b6 I feel that making a script suitable (with **FIX** in it) for a parallel run is at the \u2018Synthesis\u2019 level of Blooms taxonomy. I feel that some levels lower, e.g. \u2018Apply\u2019 with a step-by-step guide would be more suitable. Evaluations \u00b6 Overall, how would you rate today\u2019s training event? \u00b6 5: 2x 6: 2x 7: 4x 8: 11x 9: 3x 10: 3x Average: ((2 * 5) + (2 * 6) + (4 * 7) + (11 * 8) + (3 * 9) + (3 * 10)) / 25 = 7.8 Today\u2019s content and feedback to the lecturers (e.g. materials, exercises, structure): \u2013 What did you like best? \u00b6 Here I aggregate the learners feedback, where I do put some under multiple topics.

Time organization and afternoon was fast or too short \u00b6 a bit more time dedicated to Jupyter The time dedicated for the interactive session/jupyter was not sufficient to try ourselves. The last part on Parallel and multi-threaded functions was a bit fast due to time which happens of course but it would be good to learn more on that. materials The after lunch section was really difficult for me to follow, I feel like the lecturers didn\u2019t stop long enough on each topic to explain it properly and I only got a partial understanding Maybe a better distribution of time between exercises would benefit. Spend less time on the beginning and give more time to run examples on the interactive and parallel parts. Because I think this is the part were we need more help. the 14:00 to 15:00 session was a bit hard to keep up with. Time per exercise can be optimised. More time for python jupyter and GPU exercises will be good for us. Time organization: morning pace was slow compared to the afternoon one. Maybe more time of coding together with the lecturer, especially for the second part of the program (more complex concepts of batch work and interactive work) The first part was a good pace for me, but the second part was more complicated and I did not have time to follow and do the exercises. Maybe the second part could be done in another session, because it is the most important part to take use the resources and take advantage of that. However, I got many tools to start my own projects. \u2018The first part\u2019 was partially my part :-) more time for exercises in afternoon, more time for the batch section, maybe don\u2019t ask random people to answer stuff I don\u2019t like that (stress - introvert) Teaching \u00b6 Teaching was quite fast. Sometime hard to follow. I personally thought Birgitte was too fast and I could not follow. I liked Richel the most. Hey, that is a fun compliment! Thanks! more time for exercises in afternoon, more time for the batch section, maybe don\u2019t ask random people to answer stuff I don\u2019t like that (stress - introvert) I will keep asking random people, because a teacher needs to monitor the progress of all learners. However, at that day, I did not think it was necessary to share why I ask random learners and that it is recommended by the literature. I would correct this two days later, let\u2019s see if that made it into the feedback. more and slower code-alongs The pace was relatively slow, which was great. as then also those how have very limited knowledge can also keep up the pace. However, in the afternoon it clearly went more faster. Maybe speed up in the morning a bit to have more time practicing actually submitting the jobs? As that was my main motivation for this, I basically skipped the very last lecture about parallelization and instead coded to make submitting batch jobs work. Materials \u00b6 There were some errors/not updated in the exercises in the material. Also can more of the material be on the course pages instead of pointing to documentation at the centers? It makes it clearer when we don\u2019t have to go difference places I understand this feedback, yet I do think it is a bad idea: a learner should get accustomed to the documentation of his/her HPC center. Other \u00b6 If prerequisite is well informed, such as little knowledge on Linus? it would have been better. Reflection 3 \u00b6 Most of the negative feedback was about the high pace in general, yet mostly in the afternoon. I feel I was not the reason for that feedback. I did get negative feedback on: course material in one place ask random people Although I agree with the feedback, I will not change this, as there are good reasons to do so. Length of teaching today was \u00b6 Too short: 8x Adequate: 16x Too long: 1x I think learner-centered teaching would solve this, i.e. by only teaching that amount of concepts that are confirmed to be understood by an exercise. Depth of content was \u00b6 Too superficial: 5x Adequate: 20x The pace of teaching was \u00b6 Too slow: i Adequate: iiiiiiiiiiiiiii Too fast: iiiiiiii I think learner-centered teaching would solve this, as -by definition- one follows the pace of the learners. Teaching aids used (e.g. slides) were well prepared \u00b6 Agree completely: 7x Agree: 15x No strong feelings: 3x Hands-on exercises and demonstrations were \u00b6 Adequate: 17x Too few: 7x I think this is a nonsense questions: either we do exercises (i.e. active teaching) or we do demonstrations (i.e. passive teaching). Only from this question, one would have idea what was too few off: only the written texts earlier indicates that there should be more exercises. Hands-on exercises and demonstrations were well prepared \u00b6 Agree completely: 7x Agree: 13x No strong feelings: 4x Disagree: 1x How would you rate the instructors overall teaching performances? \u00b6 This is a useless question, as there were 4 teachers, but here goes: 10: 4x 9: 5x 8: 4x 7: 8x 6: 3x Average: ((4 * 10) + (5 * 9) + (4 * 8) + (8 * 7) + (3 * 6)) / 24 = 8.0 Do you feel you achieved your desired learning outcome? \u00b6 Yes: 17x Not sure: 8x Did today\u2019s course meet your expectation? \u00b6 Yes: 18x Not sure: 7x Do you have any additional comments? \u00b6 Thanks \u00b6 Thanks for the course, it was very useful and I feel encouraged to start my project. Overall a great introductory course to get grasp of the basics in a positive and supportive environment with knowledgeable instructors. Thanks for your lecture and your time. Misc \u00b6 Can we have something like BYOC and you can show us how to use it to asses time and core used using library multiprocess, please? A bit too uneven speed with too low in the morning and too high in the afternoon or at least too little time in the afternoon to go through everything Agreed, I think learning-centered teaching would solve this. Some students had problems logging in to the needed systems. I also just noted that there was this log-in session in Monday when you mentioned it on tuesday. Maybe advertise that in the very beginning of the information email so that it does not go unnoticed. I had no problems logging etc, but those who had would have benefited participating on Monday Agreed, we could be more ruthless in letting our learners in, e.g. by putting the link to the Zoom on Rackham and Kebnekaise. Diversity of teachers \u00b6 I can not evaluate the performance of each part in a single evaluation form, as I felt it was very different depending on each teacher Agreed. Zoom room \u00b6 More time to exercises. and the zoom problems made it confusing. I know it\u2019s not your fault. Maybe don\u2019t use breakout rooms so much, especially when you know there are problems? I have never been in a course where it works well to go back and forth between breakout rooms. Just use them as backup if anyone need to get private help. I agree that the technical problems are annoying. The Zoom room use, i.e. of having a silent room, I now think it is a bad idea. Instead, doing Pair-Share-Pound in little groups would make it work. Exercises \u00b6 More time to exercises. and the zoom problems made it confusing. I know it\u2019s not your fault. Maybe don\u2019t use breakout rooms so much, especially when you know there are problems? I have never been in a course where it works well to go back and forth between breakout rooms. Just use them as backup if anyone need to get private help. i really need more time for exercises Reflection 4 \u00b6 I agree that the Zoom setup could be improved, next to the technical problems. I think the evaluation questions are mostly useless for me, as judged by me thinking about them. My dream evaluation would be: What should we keep doing? Which teacher(s) scheduled enough time for exercises? What should we improve? Other comments? Course-wide interpretation \u00b6 I think the general course advice would be: talk/demonstrate less, do more exercises instead.","title":"Reflection"},{"location":"reflections/20240312_richel/#reflection","text":"Teaching day: 2023-03-12 Topic: Python Written on 2023-03-12 by Richel","title":"Reflection"},{"location":"reflections/20240312_richel/#schedule","text":"Time Topic Teacher 9.00 Syllabus Birgitte 9.10 Python in general Birgitte 9.20 Load modules and run Birgitte 9.45 Break . 10:00 Packages (45\u2013>30) Richel 10.45 Break . 11.00 Isolated environments Richel 12.00 Lunch . 13.00 Batch Birgitte 13:20 GPU Birgitte 13.30 Kebnekaise: Jupyter Birgitte .

I was annoyed with being this blind as a teacher: how can I know if the learners understood, if I cannot see their exercises?

I only taught the first hour. I talk before teaching, it feels nicer. At the start of the lecture, I shared that I will pick random people and why. Adding the \u2018why\u2019 hopefully helps learners understand why I should do that. I feel discussing teaching literature should not be done during a lesson, yet, however, it does show that I read (part of) the student evaluation. At the \u2018Prior Knowledge\u2019 part, I asked randomly and polled answers using Zoom \u2018Reactions\u2019. When discussing modules, it made me see that not everyone understood what modules are. This allowed me to backtrack and discuss what modules are. I feel I talked too long and I went to slow. Instead of going through the text, only give an overview and enough info to do the exercises. Exercises should start with \u2018read \u2026\u2019. [ ] TODO: talk less, more time for exercises Could not do \u2018Feedback\u2019 due to technical problem. Technical problem was solved after updating Zoom. There was a copy-paste mistakes in the R versions used, as there is a difference between the one on HPC2N and the one on UPPMAX. During the exercises, the learners found out, contacted me and I fixed it immediately. There were mistakes in the HPC2N answers. During the exercises, the HPC2N users found out that it did not work. This is probably because the course switched to using R 4.1.2 and it was forgotten to update the version of the prerequisite modules. During a one-on-one with a learner in a breakout room, we used module help R/4.1.2 , loaded the prerequisites of the right version and observed it worked. I immediately updated the documentation. Although there were mistakes found in my exercises, I gave the learners the most time on doing exercises, monitored their progress during this and interacted with them. Or: mistakes were found in my exercises, because the exercises were actually done with a level of interaction that allows the learners to actually share the mistakes. I wonder how many learners: have started R (I could not ask, due to technical problem) have run an R script (I could not ask, due to technical problem) I lead the evaluation. I took the learners to a Breakout room, told them why this is important, how to answer and to come back to the main room to say bye or ask questions. Things beyond my teaching \u00b6 There was a mismatch between the schedule we as teachers had in a shared HackMD document and the one on the course website. Already in a meeting, I suggested to remove the shared HackMD document one, to prevent the possibility of a mismatch, but there was resistance there. The teachers improvised. I have a hard time to summarize the learning objectives of other lessons: there is too much stuff that is \u2018nice to have\u2019 in it; it feels more like if randomly content gets added or deleted. What is the decision rule to decide what should be in and what should not for those lessons? Examples of content I remove, as it would not fit my teaching goals: describing an R package in details: this is not an R course when learning how to run an R script, running it on multiple nodes: do that in the session on parallel programs on R virtual environments: use a virtual environment, not describe what it is in detail in the parallel programs, letting learners fix code for parallelizing code: this is not a course on parallel programming.

I only taught the first hour. I talk before teaching, it feels nicer. At the start of the lecture, I shared that I will pick random people and why. Adding the \u2018why\u2019 hopefully helps learners understand why I should do that. I feel discussing teaching literature should not be done during a lesson, yet, however, it does show that I read (part of) the student evaluation. At the \u2018Prior Knowledge\u2019 part, I asked randomly and polled answers using Zoom \u2018Reactions\u2019. When discussing modules, it made me see that not everyone understood what modules are. This allowed me to backtrack and discuss what modules are. I feel I talked too long and I went to slow. Instead of going through the text, only give an overview and enough info to do the exercises. Exercises should start with \u2018read \u2026\u2019. [ ] TODO: talk less, more time for exercises Could not do \u2018Feedback\u2019 due to technical problem. Technical problem was solved after updating Zoom. There was a copy-paste mistakes in the R versions used, as there is a difference between the one on HPC2N and the one on UPPMAX. During the exercises, the learners found out, contacted me and I fixed it immediately. There were mistakes in the HPC2N answers. During the exercises, the HPC2N users found out that it did not work. This is probably because the course switched to using R 4.1.2 and it was forgotten to update the version of the prerequisite modules. During a one-on-one with a learner in a breakout room, we used module help R/4.1.2 , loaded the prerequisites of the right version and observed it worked. I immediately updated the documentation. Although there were mistakes found in my exercises, I gave the learners the most time on doing exercises, monitored their progress during this and interacted with them. Or: mistakes were found in my exercises, because the exercises were actually done with a level of interaction that allows the learners to actually share the mistakes. I wonder how many learners: have started R (I could not ask, due to technical problem) have run an R script (I could not ask, due to technical problem) I lead the evaluation. I took the learners to a Breakout room, told them why this is important, how to answer and to come back to the main room to say bye or ask questions.","title":"Reflection"},{"location":"reflections/20240314_richel/#things-beyond-my-teaching","text":"There was a mismatch between the schedule we as teachers had in a shared HackMD document and the one on the course website.

What is the decision rule to decide what should be in and what should not for those lessons? Examples of content I remove, as it would not fit my teaching goals: describing an R package in details: this is not an R course when learning how to run an R script, running it on multiple nodes: do that in the session on parallel programs on R virtual environments: use a virtual environment, not describe what it is in detail in the parallel programs, letting learners fix code for parallelizing code: this is not a course on parallel programming.

Reflection before teaching \u00b6 Before teaching, one thing that I think can be improved, is our decision making. As an example, there was a change decided upon regarding the schedule on 2024-10-18 (course is at 2024-10-21), after we\u2019ve already voted to accept the schedule before that. I was unconvinced that we should change the schedule, but I was a minority, so I accepted the democratic decision to change the schedule again. I hope next time we can decide on the schedule earlier and freeze it, say, at least one week before the course. Before teaching, one thing that I think can be improved too, is to use Markdown instead of RestructuredText: using RestructuredText makes everything I do harder. Taking a look at the StackOverflow developer survey of 2023 , Markdown is mentioned and admired, where RestructuredText is completely absent. I\u2019d enjoy converting all these pages to Markdown and then use good MkDocs instead Before teaching, I was wondering about how we make sure the learners log in. Currently, there is an onboarding session and a daily 9:00-9:50 optional login session. I feel we treat the learners better than reasonable: when it is in the course prerequisites that its is required to be able to log in and we have an onboarding, we should be able to assume that learners can log in. This means that when a learner joins without being able to log in, it is acceptable to only help the learner when there is time (which is close to never). One way to meet in the middle, is to have daily log in sessions at 8:00, so this will not affect the teaching. Before teaching, I saw the evaluation. Beyond the \u2018rate your confidence\u2019 questions I prepared, more questions were added. Maybe because HPC2N requires that. These are the questions in the evaluation now: Introduction to running R, Python, Julia, and Matlab in HPC, 22-25/10-2024 - DAY 1 Python Thanks for your feedback. This feedback will be published as-is at the end of the evaluation period (after 1 November 2024), if and only if there are no personal details (email, address, etc.) in the feedback. Do mention the teachers, assistants, etc by name! 1.Overall, how would you rate today's training event? - Value from 1 to and including 10 2.Today's content and feedback to the lecturers (e.g. materials, exercises, structure): \u2013 What did you like best? - Open question 3.Today's content and feedback to the lecturers (e.g. materials, exercises, structure): \u2013 Where should we improve? - Open question 4.Training event organisation (e.g. announcement, registration, ...): \u2013 What did you like best? \u2013 Where should we improve? - Open question 5.Length of teaching today was - Adequate - Too short - Too long 6.Depth of content was - Adequate - Too superficial - Too profound 7.The pace of teaching was - Adequate - Too slow - Too fast 8.Teaching aids used (e.g. slides) were well prepared - Agree completely - Agree - No strong feelings - Disagree - Disagree completely 9.Hands-on exercises and demonstrations were - Adequate - Too few - Too many 10.Hands-on exercises and demonstrations were well prepared - Agree completely - Agree - No strong feelings - Disagree - Disagree completely 11.How would you rate the separate sessions? - Introduction - Load and run - Packages - Isolated environments - Python in batch - Interactive work - Jupyter - Parallel - Conda With answers - Poor - Fair - Good - Very good - Excellent - Did not attend Give you confidence levels of the following statements, using this scale: - 0: I don't know even what this is about ...? - 1: I have no confidence I can do this - 2: I have low confidence I can do this - 3: I have some confidence I can do this - 4: I have good confidence I can do this - 5: I absolutely can do this!

Question 11 is useful to me, but needlessly personal, hurtful and I don\u2019t care about satisfaction. [ ] In meeting with teachers, discuss the evaluation form Reflection after teaching \u00b6 9:18: Around 12 learners have visited. After telling each of them that they can go if (1) they have logged in and (2) can use a text editor, around 3 hang around with their cameras off. I assume they are waiting for the lesson to start. [x] Make this more explicit in the Python and R schedule The course started at 10:01. Due to technical issues, I took over the first sessions without any preparations. I improvised in following the Mike Bell teaching model with Prior, Present, Challenge and Feedback and I think that went well enough. During this improvised session, around a third of the learners had their camera on, as per my request. I felt there was enough time to work on exercises without disturbance. When the technical issues were over, at 10:35, my colleague took over the teacher role again. In that improvised sessions, I did not talk much about IPython, as I feel it is useless and time should be spent differently, hence I predict low confidence for IPython. Additionally, a colleague helped me remind about a shared document where learners can ask questions. Also here, I spent less time on this shared document, as I think it is not worth my time to talk about a shared document I do not care about. I am happy how we, teachers, dealt with the technical problem. There was a learner that found a mistake in my teaching material, about a mismatch in versions of matplotlib. I already fixed it :-) My prepared part started at the 11:05 sharp (as per schedule). Here, a fourth of the learners had their camera on. I felt there was enough time to work on exercises without disturbance. The durations of the sessions was long enough. When polling if learners had completed the exercise by using Zoom Reactions, two thirds gave a \u2018yes\u2019 as a reaction, the rest (all without camera) having a \u2018no\u2019 as a reaction. One thing I did wrong, was a question from a LUNARC. She wanted to know if pip list --user required an additional argument, such as a username. Instead of asking for clarification first, I rushed to give an answer, that was different from her question. My bad! One possible cause for this is that I feel insecure about pip list --user : I\u2019ve never used it and I don\u2019t care, but it was in the course material. I should remove this. [x] Remove pip list --user from the course material After the break, there was a simultaneous session that I was allowed to teach, for UPPMAX users only. There 6 out of the 7 learners had their camera on. Here, all learners with a camera having achieved the teaching goal of starting Jupyter. 1 out of 7 got stuck and I lead her to also start Jupyter. I felt there was enough time to work on the exercise without disturbance. The durations of the session was long enough. I did not prepare for this session at all, as the material was good enough: I\u2019d feel at home with an UPPMAX-only group anyways and am confident I can improvise there. I did not use the course material at all, instead send the learners to the documentation page with the procedure. I think that that documentation page can be improved, by rewriting an existing page. [x] Improve https://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/jupyter/ similar to https://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/jupyter_on_bianca/ [x] Add video What I noticed in the simultaneous session, upon questioning the learners, that 6 out of 6 learners did not know what a login node is. From that I infer that this course is the first formal introduction to our clusters for most of our learners. For the summary and evaluation, I used question 12 of the evaluation form. I think that was good enough. I did not use a breakout room, as we did not practice that enough today. In more general terms: I am happy to have had questions asked by learners during sessions. It hints that some think I am approachable. I am happy that all my exercises have answers and a video: the Feedback is there. Also, Feedback consisted out of two demos by learners and one one-on-one demo by me. The answers I provide, however, can be improved, by adding more \u2018How does that look like?\u2019 dropdowns. I did not do it this time, as I struggled with the RST markup too much All my exercise sessions were 15 minutes. This was a good length. It was a lot of waiting and I was able to be silent too I am happy that my exercises use wget instead of a tarball. The word \u2018tarball\u2019 seemed already new for the learners, judging by their facial expression I am reasonably happy with the amount of interaction I got. I spoke with all learners that had their camera on. There were too many cameras off for my taste, maybe the recording causes this? Suggests for next course: The prerequirements should only be pre-requirements, not things that are \u2018nice to have\u2019. I suggest to remove the whole \u2018Get familiar with the Linux/Bash command line\u2019 session The login sessions should only be about login. Stating what the goal of this optional session is, would be enough. I suggest to remove anything but that. Remove IPython from session on running Python The evaluation form will be useless: in a course with 4 teachers, rating the course as a whole gives little information that is useful to a teacher. I don\u2019t care about the satisfaction of learners either: all I care about is if they have learned something, i.e. if they are confident in a topic I taught. I am interested in their free comments too. Besides that, the evaluation form feels like an administrative monster Summary of evaluation results \u00b6 There are 5 evaluation results, out of the 9 learners that stayed in the end. 1. Overall, how would you rate today's training event? - 7.4. Average Number This question gives me no useful info. 2. Today's content and feedback to the lecturers (e.g. materials, exercises, structure): \u2013 What did you like best? - \"the best parts were how to find correct modules, submit jobs, and the examples for parallel codes \" - \"materials\" This question gives me no useful info. 3. Today's content and feedback to the lecturers (e.g. materials, exercises, structure): \u2013 Where should we improve? - \"the lecturers shouldn't say the person's names and point to specific persons to reply questions\" - \"Going through the examples more throughly.\" I will definitely keep pointing to learners, as per the literature. When I told the class I would do so, I told them to turn off the cameras if they\u2019d be uncomfortable with me doing so. I don\u2019t know why this learner kept his/her camera on if he/she is uncomfortable with this. I did explain why I think this is important (to get to know what all learners think, not just the ones that are more vocal) and I stressed multiple times that \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 is a fine answer too. In other courses, where I take the time to show my teaching style, this feedback is not found in the evaluations. Next time, I will show the references to the literature again. [ ] Next iteration: take the time to discuss my teaching style 4. Training event organisation (e.g. announcement, registration, ...): \u2013 What did you like best? \u2013 Where should we improve? - \"material online is excellent\" - \"well organized\" No info. 5. Length of teaching today was Adequate 3 Too short 1 Too long 1 No info. 6. Depth of content was Adequate 5 Too superficial 0 Too profound 0 No info. 7. The pace of teaching was Adequate 3 Too slow 0 Too fast 2 No info: which session? 8. Teaching aids used (e.g. slides) were well prepared Agree completely 0 Agree 4 No strong feelings 0 Disagree 1 Disagree completely 0 No info: which session? 9. Hands-on exercises and demonstrations were Adequate 3 Too few 2 Too many 0 No info: which session? 10. Hands-on exercises and demonstrations were well prepared Agree completely 3 Agree 2 No strong feelings 0 Disagree 0 Disagree completely 0 No info: which session? 11. How would you rate the separate sessions? I am happy to see that the \u2018Excellents\u2019 are all in sections that I taught (\u2018Packages\u2019, \u2018Isolated environments\u2019) or that I may have taught (i.e. these we discussed in the simultaneous session) (\u2018Interactive work\u2019, \u2018Jupyter\u2019) or that I partially taught (\u2018Load and run\u2019). The lowest rating (\u2018poor\u2019) is in none of my sessions. I do see a low \u2018fair\u2019 rating in my sessions, except for Jupyter, where there are more teachers. My theory is that the person that did not like to be addressed by name followed Jupyter in the HPC2N or LUNARC session and gave a \u2018fair\u2019 to the other sessions. 12. Give your confidence levels of the following statements I am happy to see that the IPython question is not there. Seems like I am not the only one that thinks it can be removed from the course material? The confidences that were lowest of the part I am one of the teachers are \u2018I can start an interactive session with multiple cores\u2019 and \u2018I can check that I am in an interactive session with multiple cores\u2019. I for sure did not teach this, as I felt there are more important things to do. Also: I think other things are more important. The sessions that I do care about .. I can determine the version of a Python package I can determine that a Python package is/is not installed I can load a Python (machine learning) module I can install a Python package I can work (create, activate, work, deactivate) with a venv virtual environment \u2026 did reasonably well, with 1 learner stating \u2018I have some confidence in this\u2019. I wish I knew what was the problem with that one learner. A weird response is \u2018I can export and import a virtual environment\u2019, which had same confidences as the other session, although I did not teach it! I hoped that the learners would all state \u2018I have no idea what this is about\u2019. Maybe some carry-over effect? [x] Remove question \u2018I can export and import a virtual environment\u2019 from evaluation 13.Did today's course meet your expectation? Yes 3 No 0 Not sure 2 Useless info to me. 14. Which future training topics would you like to be provided by the training host(s)? \"- xarray and dask\" Useless info to me. 15. Do you have any additional comments? - A sheet summarizing the most important parts with key code snippets to do the items in 12)\" Fun! This learner suggests that I actually should have worked on a proper summary page, with -indeed- the key points. Will do so next time! Thanks!

As an example, there was a change decided upon regarding the schedule on 2024-10-18 (course is at 2024-10-21), after we\u2019ve already voted to accept the schedule before that. I was unconvinced that we should change the schedule, but I was a minority, so I accepted the democratic decision to change the schedule again. I hope next time we can decide on the schedule earlier and freeze it, say, at least one week before the course. Before teaching, one thing that I think can be improved too, is to use Markdown instead of RestructuredText: using RestructuredText makes everything I do harder. Taking a look at the StackOverflow developer survey of 2023 , Markdown is mentioned and admired, where RestructuredText is completely absent. I\u2019d enjoy converting all these pages to Markdown and then use good MkDocs instead Before teaching, I was wondering about how we make sure the learners log in. Currently, there is an onboarding session and a daily 9:00-9:50 optional login session. I feel we treat the learners better than reasonable: when it is in the course prerequisites that its is required to be able to log in and we have an onboarding, we should be able to assume that learners can log in. This means that when a learner joins without being able to log in, it is acceptable to only help the learner when there is time (which is close to never). One way to meet in the middle, is to have daily log in sessions at 8:00, so this will not affect the teaching. Before teaching, I saw the evaluation. Beyond the \u2018rate your confidence\u2019 questions I prepared, more questions were added. Maybe because HPC2N requires that.

After telling each of them that they can go if (1) they have logged in and (2) can use a text editor, around 3 hang around with their cameras off. I assume they are waiting for the lesson to start. [x] Make this more explicit in the Python and R schedule The course started at 10:01. Due to technical issues, I took over the first sessions without any preparations. I improvised in following the Mike Bell teaching model with Prior, Present, Challenge and Feedback and I think that went well enough. During this improvised session, around a third of the learners had their camera on, as per my request. I felt there was enough time to work on exercises without disturbance. When the technical issues were over, at 10:35, my colleague took over the teacher role again. In that improvised sessions, I did not talk much about IPython, as I feel it is useless and time should be spent differently, hence I predict low confidence for IPython. Additionally, a colleague helped me remind about a shared document where learners can ask questions. Also here, I spent less time on this shared document, as I think it is not worth my time to talk about a shared document I do not care about. I am happy how we, teachers, dealt with the technical problem. There was a learner that found a mistake in my teaching material, about a mismatch in versions of matplotlib. I already fixed it :-) My prepared part started at the 11:05 sharp (as per schedule). Here, a fourth of the learners had their camera on. I felt there was enough time to work on exercises without disturbance. The durations of the sessions was long enough. When polling if learners had completed the exercise by using Zoom Reactions, two thirds gave a \u2018yes\u2019 as a reaction, the rest (all without camera) having a \u2018no\u2019 as a reaction. One thing I did wrong, was a question from a LUNARC. She wanted to know if pip list --user required an additional argument, such as a username. Instead of asking for clarification first, I rushed to give an answer, that was different from her question. My bad! One possible cause for this is that I feel insecure about pip list --user : I\u2019ve never used it and I don\u2019t care, but it was in the course material. I should remove this. [x] Remove pip list --user from the course material After the break, there was a simultaneous session that I was allowed to teach, for UPPMAX users only. There 6 out of the 7 learners had their camera on. Here, all learners with a camera having achieved the teaching goal of starting Jupyter. 1 out of 7 got stuck and I lead her to also start Jupyter. I felt there was enough time to work on the exercise without disturbance. The durations of the session was long enough. I did not prepare for this session at all, as the material was good enough: I\u2019d feel at home with an UPPMAX-only group anyways and am confident I can improvise there. I did not use the course material at all, instead send the learners to the documentation page with the procedure. I think that that documentation page can be improved, by rewriting an existing page. [x] Improve https://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/jupyter/ similar to https://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/jupyter_on_bianca/ [x] Add video What I noticed in the simultaneous session, upon questioning the learners, that 6 out of 6 learners did not know what a login node is. From that I infer that this course is the first formal introduction to our clusters for most of our learners. For the summary and evaluation, I used question 12 of the evaluation form. I think that was good enough. I did not use a breakout room, as we did not practice that enough today. In more general terms: I am happy to have had questions asked by learners during sessions. It hints that some think I am approachable. I am happy that all my exercises have answers and a video: the Feedback is there. Also, Feedback consisted out of two demos by learners and one one-on-one demo by me. The answers I provide, however, can be improved, by adding more \u2018How does that look like?\u2019 dropdowns. I did not do it this time, as I struggled with the RST markup too much All my exercise sessions were 15 minutes. This was a good length. It was a lot of waiting and I was able to be silent too I am happy that my exercises use wget instead of a tarball. The word \u2018tarball\u2019 seemed already new for the learners, judging by their facial expression I am reasonably happy with the amount of interaction I got. I spoke with all learners that had their camera on. There were too many cameras off for my taste, maybe the recording causes this? Suggests for next course: The prerequirements should only be pre-requirements, not things that are \u2018nice to have\u2019. I suggest to remove the whole \u2018Get familiar with the Linux/Bash command line\u2019 session The login sessions should only be about login. Stating what the goal of this optional session is, would be enough. I suggest to remove anything but that. Remove IPython from session on running Python The evaluation form will be useless: in a course with 4 teachers, rating the course as a whole gives little information that is useful to a teacher. I don\u2019t care about the satisfaction of learners either: all I care about is if they have learned something, i.e. if they are confident in a topic I taught. I am interested in their free comments too. Besides that, the evaluation form feels like an administrative monster","title":"Reflection after teaching"},{"location":"reflections/20241022_richel/#summary-of-evaluation-results","text":"There are 5 evaluation results, out of the 9 learners that stayed in the end. 1.

The lowest rating (\u2018poor\u2019) is in none of my sessions. I do see a low \u2018fair\u2019 rating in my sessions, except for Jupyter, where there are more teachers. My theory is that the person that did not like to be addressed by name followed Jupyter in the HPC2N or LUNARC session and gave a \u2018fair\u2019 to the other sessions. 12.

Training event organisation (e.g. announcement, registration, ...): \u2013 What did you like best? \u2013 Where should we improve? - \"I liked the general organization, felt like any questions one might have where answered in the introductory email.\" Nice for Birgitte! 5.

Give your confidence levels of the following statements My learning objectives: I can find the module to be able to run R: 1x some, 1x good, 3x absolutely I can load the module to be able to run R: 1 some, 1 good, 3 absolutely I can run the R interpreter: 1 some, 1 good, 3 absolutely I can run the R command to get the list of installed R packages: 1 some, 1 good, 3 absolutely I can run an R script from the command-line: 1 some, 2 good, 2 absolutely I can find out if an R package is already installed: 1 some, 1 good, 3 absolutely I can start an interactive session: 1 low, 1 some, 1 good, 2 absolutely I can verify I am on the login node yes/no: 2 some, 2 good, 1 absolutely I can start an interactive session with multiple cores: 2 some, 1 good, 2 absolutely I can start RStudio: 1 some, 1 good, 3 absolutely It seems my simultaneous session was weakest: they did feel confident to start RStudio, but starting an interactive node and verify on which node(s) was indeed done a bit too informal in hindsight. It is weird that a learner has a low confidence in starting any interactive session, but some confidence when it is multiple cores\u2026?

There are some policies regarding this, that we ask that you follow: > > You may be given access to the project before the course; please do not use the allocation for running your own codes. Usage of the project before the course means the priority of jobs submitted to it goes down, diminishing the opportunity for you and your fellow participants to run the examples during the course. > The course project will be open 1-2 weeks after the course, giving the participants the opportunity to test run examples and shorter codes related to the course. During this time, we ask that you only use it for running course related jobs. Use your own discretion, but it could be: (modified) examples from the hands-on, short personal codes that have been modified to test things learned at the course, etc. > Anyone found to be misusing the course project, using up large amounts of the allocation for their own production runs, will be removed from the course project. > When the course is no longer active, all files in the attached storage directory will be deleted.

I quote: Students learn new material better and can remember it longer when they learn it by engaging in an activity than when they passively watch or listen to an instructor talk [8 references] [\u2026] long lectures and presentations will fail because students stop viewing and listening after about six minutes. This phenomenon parallels McKeachie\u2019s earlier classroom findings about inattention after five to ten minutes [reference]. In online classes, such student inattention becomes explicitly visible through electronic monitoring of activities and questions from students about what has already been covered in a long presentation.

Q5: suggestions for future topics \u00b6 More on parallelizing in R Even more? It would be nice to perhaps have a little module on transferring files to and from the server: while I feel pretty confident about using R, I\u2019m not completelt sure how to get files to and from he server. Maybe link to the NAISS file transfer course [x] Link to the NAISS file transfer course in the course material And secondly, I\u2019m 99% sure it should be reasonably straightforward, but it might be nice for there to be a little extra note on best practices for installing and using STAN for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). R, Julia and MATLAB can work with STAN, and because MCMC is such a slow process, I can imagine that this could be helpful. This feels quite niche to me. Q6: other feedback \u00b6 For some portions of this course it was a bit unclear when/what to do hands-on. Agree: it was unclear to me too sometimes. I am unsure if this applies to my session. The course documentation is very good and will help me the most in the future. Nice. I really liked the materials and the web page. It was extremely helpful, and I have bookmarked the course page because it is easier to use than all the official documentation. Nice. The exercises were well-prepared, Nice \u2026 although the parallel processing section was less good on both the web page, and the exercise code needed a bit of editing to get it to work. Not my session The organization was great Well done course coordinator! however the initial email maybe didn\u2019t make it quite clear enough that setting up a login account could take many days. I happened to already have one, but sitting the day before to try to set up, I could easily have missed that. Consider: [x] Suggest to make even clearer that getting an account takes days I really appreciate the amount of hands-on demonstrations: they were great. Unsure if this applies to me. Only a very, very small comment is that it was not always clear which .sh file was appropriate for the relevant exercises, for instance serial and parallel at the start. The exercises might be named with the same names, which would make it easier to find them. But this is such a small complaint. Does not apply to me. This seems like an easy fix. The whole material for the day was excellent, and I\u2019m feeling extremely confident about moving forward with getting started. Nice. I had some issues with my account not being set up correctly, which set me behind for the whole course and meant there were some things I couldn\u2019t test myself as they were being explained. This was not the fault of the course facilitators, but did make the course less useful for me. Agree. I liked the exercises best, makes it easy to understand how you can directly apply. I would have appreciated more time for them though. I agree. The same feedback as always :-) The length of the course is good, Nice. the machine learning part was difficult for me to follow. I agree.

I quote: Students learn new material better and can remember it longer when they learn it by engaging in an activity than when they passively watch or listen to an instructor talk [8 references] [\u2026] long lectures and presentations will fail because students stop viewing and listening after about six minutes. This phenomenon parallels McKeachie\u2019s earlier classroom findings about inattention after five to ten minutes [reference]. In online classes, such student inattention becomes explicitly visible through electronic monitoring of activities and questions from students about what has already been covered in a long presentation.

I was ill already for a week and hence was more absent from all team discussions. Teaching 9:00 First login \u00b6 There were 5 visitors. Me and the team were able to help all of them. I\u2019ve helped 1 learner and it was a good experience: she was a complete beginner and at the end of my, around 15 minutes, help, she was super ready. Teaching 10:00 Load modules and run \u00b6 There were 6 learners. Most time was spent with the 1 learner that did not attend the login session. When ill, my talking is slower. A good thing. However, due to the constant pain, I do not enjoy my teaching sessions as usual. I did meet all students properly. At 10:47 2 (out of 6) were done: I sent them on an earlier break. Teaching 14:00 RStudio \u00b6 Me and a colleague split up the learners: the colleague offered to help, as it was unsure how well I was (as I was less response in chat, due to -indeed- illness). I think it is nice to get unexpected help and I think it is a good idea that she had a 1-on-1 with \u2018her\u2019 COSMOS users. So, we split up, after announcing this in the main room. I was very happy to see my learners again. We were with 3, 1 that used Sigma, and 2 that used Dardel. I started with the Sigma user, as (1) she has no documentation, and (2) Dardel has Open OnDemand, which is easier. I did so after discussing this with the whole group. When the Sigma user was in the system (for the first time), I told her to try a bit for herself, so I could talk to the Dardel users. We agreed. I disturbed the Dardel users. They were already done. I told them that in 5 minutes I will give a bit more in-depth demo about RStudio, after helping the Sigma user (which I estimated to cost that long). The Dardel users agreed. The Sigma user was in quickly, so we started talking as a class again. I did my demo on RStudio, until it was time again to back to the main room. I remember from earlier reflections that I should not be too informal, and I think I succeeded reasonably (but not perfectly) well: it felt too nice to have them back :-) 15:00 Summary and Evaluation \u00b6 I went through the summary. What was missing was a list of other course. [x] Add link to SCoRe list of courses The evaluation was clean: I told them why I put them in breakout rooms. One out of six learners came back to ask his questions, which I discussed in a breakout room. Predictions \u00b6 My sessions went very well: In the \u2018Load modules and run\u2019 session, I have seen all run the R interpreter In the RStudio session, I have seen all run RStudio Evaluation results \u00b6 My success score : 75% The only useful item is \u2018Do you have any additional comments?\u2019: I liked the online material about how to prepare and get everything set up, which has been my main issue so far. Unfortunately I could not initially run R via the terminal/ssh, so I couldn\u2019t do the practicals on batch, but I am sure I can figure it out myself. Too bad. Nothing to be done about that I guess \u2026? no Sure :-) no Sure :-) awesome material and good that you record but could you record during the lectures all of you so we get the exact thing that is taught? i\u2019m also not fond of having to have the camera on which i felt there was pressure to do so i watched most after the course instead This is an interesting comment: on the one hand this person mentions to not like the camera. On the other hand, the learning outcomes for my early sessions for that person are highest: Learning outcome Camera Confidence I can find the module to be able to run R Yes I can absolutely do this! I can load the module to be able to run R Yes I can absolutely do this! I can run the R interpreter Yes I can absolutely do this! I can run the R command to get the list of installed R packages Yes I can absolutely do this! I can run an R script from the command-line Yes I have good confidence I can do this I can find out if an R package is already installed No I have good confidence I can do this I can load the pre-installed R packages No I have good confidence I can do this I can install an R package from CRAN No I have good confidence I can do this I can submit a job to the scheduler to run an R script with regular code No I have some confidence I can do this I can submit a job to the scheduler to run an R script that uses parallel code No I have some confidence I can do this I can start an interactive session No I have low confidence I can do this So in this case, higher learning outcomes were achieved in the sessions with a camera, including by the person that did not like using a camera. About having videos to the material, I find that live recordings have \u2018No performance advantage was found for viewing recordings despite students\u2019 positive perception of their utility.\u2019 [Lesser, Melissa, and Lora Packel. \u201cEducational Lessons from a Pandemic: Lecture Recording and Learning Outcomes.\u201d Internet Journal of Allied Health Sciences and Practice 22.2 (2024): 9., Link to paper ]. However, that paper does find positive effects for learners that, unlike here, use it after attending a session. The RStudio sessions \u00b6 I\u2019ve compared the simultaneous sessions of this course\u2019s iteration with the previous course iteration where I was the only teacher: learning_outcome teacher average_confidence I can start an interactive session with multiple cores RB+RP 1.4 I can verify I am on the login node yes/no RB+RP 1.5 I can start RStudio RB+RP 2.7 I can verify I am on the login node yes/no RB 3.1 I can start an interactive session with multiple cores RB 3.1 I can start RStudio RB 3.4 It seems same enough. The biggest differences are from things that one does not need when using Open OnDemand. [ ] Remove learning outcome \u2018I can start an interactive session with multiple cores\u2019 [ ] Remove learning outcome \u2018I can verify I am on the login node yes/no\u2019 Taking a look at the confidences per question for RStudio: Could it be that we both scored \u2018I can absolutely do this!\u2019 and that deviations from this are explained by people not following the session? Here is when learners rated the RStudio session: Starting time Confidence for \u2018I can start RStudio\u2019 10/6/2025 14:45 I can absolutely do this! 10/6/2025 14:54 I have no confidence I can do this 10/6/2025 14:53 I can absolutely do this! 10/6/2025 14:53 I can absolutely do this! 10/6/2025 14:53 I can absolutely do this! 10/17/2025 13:09 I have no confidence I can do this I think the last person may not have followed this session at all. It would make sense: I\u2019ve had 2 and Rebecca had -according to my notes- 2 or 3. I think it is likely enough that 4x \u2018I can absolutely do this!\u2019 comes from the 4 learners attending our session and the 1x \u2018I have no confidence I can do this\u2019 comes from the COSMOS SENS person. I conclude that me and Rebecca did a perfect job! This brings us to another problem: the learner that was absent filled in a \u2018I have no confidence I can do this\u2019 over skipping the question. As far as I remember, it was impossible to skip questions.

I started with the Sigma user, as (1) she has no documentation, and (2) Dardel has Open OnDemand, which is easier. I did so after discussing this with the whole group. When the Sigma user was in the system (for the first time), I told her to try a bit for herself, so I could talk to the Dardel users. We agreed. I disturbed the Dardel users. They were already done. I told them that in 5 minutes I will give a bit more in-depth demo about RStudio, after helping the Sigma user (which I estimated to cost that long). The Dardel users agreed. The Sigma user was in quickly, so we started talking as a class again. I did my demo on RStudio, until it was time again to back to the main room. I remember from earlier reflections that I should not be too informal, and I think I succeeded reasonably (but not perfectly) well: it felt too nice to have them back :-)","title":"Teaching 14:00 RStudio"},{"location":"reflections/20251006_richel/#1500-summary-and-evaluation","text":"I went through the summary.

Nothing to be done about that I guess \u2026? no Sure :-) no Sure :-) awesome material and good that you record but could you record during the lectures all of you so we get the exact thing that is taught? i\u2019m also not fond of having to have the camera on which i felt there was pressure to do so i watched most after the course instead This is an interesting comment: on the one hand this person mentions to not like the camera. On the other hand, the learning outcomes for my early sessions for that person are highest: Learning outcome Camera Confidence I can find the module to be able to run R Yes I can absolutely do this! I can load the module to be able to run R Yes I can absolutely do this! I can run the R interpreter Yes I can absolutely do this! I can run the R command to get the list of installed R packages Yes I can absolutely do this! I can run an R script from the command-line Yes I have good confidence I can do this I can find out if an R package is already installed No I have good confidence I can do this I can load the pre-installed R packages No I have good confidence I can do this I can install an R package from CRAN No I have good confidence I can do this I can submit a job to the scheduler to run an R script with regular code No I have some confidence I can do this I can submit a job to the scheduler to run an R script that uses parallel code No I have some confidence I can do this I can start an interactive session No I have low confidence I can do this So in this case, higher learning outcomes were achieved in the sessions with a camera, including by the person that did not like using a camera.
